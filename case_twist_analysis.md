## 1) COMPANY TYPE

**Yes, our case company IS a mid-sized IPP (Independent Power Producer).**

The case explicitly states: "Your team reports directly to the CEO of a mid-sized publicly traded pure-play independent power company (IPP)."

**Is it still an IPP in the Case Twist?** Yes. The twist doesn't change what the company IS — it changes what the company should DO NEXT. The company is still an IPP that generates electricity and sells it into wholesale markets. The twist introduces a dissident investor (an "activist" shareholder) who wants faster action and threatens a hostile takeover of the board.

> **Simple Language:** An IPP is like a factory that makes electricity and sells it on the open market, instead of being a traditional electric company that sends you a monthly bill. Think of it as a "freelance" power plant operator.

---

## 2) CATEGORIES/SUBJECTS THE COMPANY WORKS IN

The company operates in these areas:

- **Power Generation** — making electricity from coal, natural gas, and nuclear fuel
- **Wholesale Energy Markets** — selling that electricity through the PJM market (a big power trading system covering the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest US)
- **Capacity Markets** — getting paid to be "available" to produce power even when not running
- **AI/Data Center Power** — the hot new area where tech companies desperately need power

> **Simple Language:** The company makes electricity using different fuels and sells it like a product in a marketplace called PJM. Now tech companies building AI supercomputers want to buy TONS of this electricity.

## 3) CURRENT STATUS INFORMATION

| Metric | Value | Simple Explanation |
|--------|-------|-------------------|
| Market Cap | ~$20 billion | Total value of all the company's stock |
| Enterprise Value (EV) | ~$23 billion | Total company value including debt |
| EV/EBITDA Multiple | 30X | How expensive the stock is — very high for a power company |
| Shares Outstanding | ~45 million | Number of stock pieces floating around |
| Adj FCF/Share | $10.20 | Cash the company earns per share after spending |
| Total Capacity | 13,000 MW | How much power it CAN make at full blast |
| Annual Generation | ~55 TWh | How much power it actually makes per year |
| Average Power Price | $51/MWh | Average price it gets for its electricity |
| Annual O&M | ~$650 million | Yearly cost to operate and maintain the plants |
| Net Debt | ~$3.1 billion | Total borrowing minus cash on hand |
| Cash on Hand | $260 million | Money sitting in the bank right now |
| Credit Rating | BB (secured) | Below investment grade — "junk" rated |
| Capital Budget | ~$290 million/year | Yearly budget for big investments |
| Total Assets | ~$6 billion | Everything the company owns |
| Shareholder Return Target | 70% of Adj FCF | Company gives 70% of its cash profits back to investors |

**Generation Asset Breakdown:**

| Fuel | Type | Capacity (MW) |
|------|------|---------------|
| Nuclear | Baseload | 2,200 |
| Natural Gas | Peaker | 3,100 |
| Natural Gas | Baseload | 3,400 |
| Coal | Intermediate | 600 |
| Coal | Baseload | 200 |
| Coal/Nat Gas | Intermediate | 1,400 |
| **TOTAL** | | **~10,900 MW (nameplate)** |

> Note: Case says 13,000 MW owned capacity but nameplate only sums to ~10,900. The remaining ~2,100 MW likely represents contracted or managed capacity.

## 4) CHALLENGES THE COMPANY FACES

From the **Case Twist** specifically:

1. **Activist Investor Threat** — A "dissident investor" (like a hostile shareholder) owns 9% of the stock and is about to hit 10%. At 10%, he can call a special meeting to fire management and replace the board.

2. **"Not Moving Fast Enough"** — The activist thinks the company isn't growing or changing quickly enough to unlock hidden value.

3. **Overvaluation Risk** — Trading at 30X EV/EBITDA is extremely high for a power company (typical is 8-12X), meaning the stock could crash if growth doesn't materialize.

4. **Capital Constraints** — Only $290M/year capex budget vs. multi-billion-dollar opportunities in the market.

5. **BB Credit Rating** — Junk-rated debt limits borrowing ability.

> **Simple Language:** An aggressive investor is buying up stock and is about to have enough power to fire the bosses. He thinks they're too slow. Meanwhile, the stock price is really high and could drop if the company doesn't do something big fast.

---

## 4.5) THEIR GOAL

**Satisfy the dissident investor** to prevent a hostile board takeover, while simultaneously:
- Growing earnings and market cap
- Increasing Adjusted Free Cash Flow per share by 30%+ annually
- Possibly earning a higher trading multiple (more "AI-related" = higher stock price)
- Creating real, provable shareholder value

> **Simple Language:** Stop the angry investor from taking over, by making a big strategic move that makes the company worth MORE money.

---

## 4.6) REQUIREMENTS FOR THE TEAM

1. **Choose one of the three strategic options** (or a combination)
2. **Use a REAL company** — any acquisition, sale, or JV must name an actual publicly traded company
3. **Provide a purchase price or sale terms** (stock, cash, or combination)
4. **Show the financial impact** — how does the deal affect FCF/share growth, earnings, multiple, shareholder value?
5. **Delineate benefits to shareholders** — explain clearly why this is good for investors
6. **Present in 15 slides max, 15-minute presentation**

---

## 5) THE THREE OPTIONS — EXPLAINED SIMPLY

### Option 1: INTEGRATE DOWNSTREAM → Buy a Data Center Company
- **What it means:** Our power company buys a company that USES electricity (a data center operator), so we become both the maker AND the user of power.
- **Why:** Data center companies trade at higher stock multiples (40-60X) than power companies (8-12X). Owning one could pull our multiple UP.
- **Think of it like:** A wheat farmer buying a bakery — you sell bread (higher value) instead of just wheat.

### Option 2: SELL UPSTREAM → Get Acquired by Shell or ExxonMobil
- **What it means:** A giant oil/gas company buys our entire company. We stop being independent.
- **Why:** Shell/Exxon have natural gas (the fuel our plants burn). Owning power plants lets them sell gas AND electricity — vertical integration.
- **Think of it like:** The wheat farmer selling the farm to a giant food conglomerate — shareholders get a premium on their stock.

### Option 3: JOINT VENTURE (JV) → Partner Rather Than Buy or Sell
- **What it means:** Team up with either an oil company (upstream) or a data center company (downstream) through a shared partnership — without a full acquisition.
- **Why:** Less risky than a full merger. Share costs, share profits.
- **Think of it like:** The wheat farmer partners with a bakery — each keeps their own business, but they work together and split the profits.

---

## 6) CHAIN OF THOUGHT ANALYSIS: BEST OPTION

### Step 1: What does the activist actually want?
He wants FASTER value creation. He thinks the stock is undervalued or management is too slow. He needs to see a BOLD move that clearly benefits shareholders.

### Step 2: Evaluate each option against the activist's demands:

**Option 1 (Buy Data Center):**
- Pros: Higher multiple, faster growth, AI narrative
- Cons: Power companies don't know how to run data centers. Data center companies are VERY expensive right now (40-60X multiples). A $20B market cap company can't afford a large data center operator. Huge execution risk.
- Risk: Could destroy value if overpaid or poorly integrated.

**Option 2 (Sell to Shell/Exxon):**
- Pros: Shareholders get an immediate premium (typically 20-40% above market). Clean exit. Certain value delivery.
- Cons: Company ceases to exist as independent. Management loses jobs. May not achieve max premium if buyer has leverage.
- Risk: Regulatory approval delays; cultural clash.

**Option 3 (JV):**
- Pros: Keeps independence. Lower risk. Can do both upstream AND downstream partnerships.
- Cons: Slower value creation than outright sale. JVs can be messy to manage. May not be "bold" enough for the activist.
- Risk: Activist may say "not enough" — he wants transformation, not a partnership.

### Step 3: Critical Thinking — What's the RIGHT answer?

**RECOMMENDED: Option 2 (Sell to Shell) is the strongest single option, BUT the best presentation would be a HYBRID of Option 2 + Option 3.**

**Here's why:**

1. **The 30X EV/EBITDA multiple is unsustainable.** This company trades at a MASSIVE premium. Any stumble and the stock crashes. Selling NOW locks in value for shareholders at a premium.

2. **Shell is explicitly growing its US power business.** Shell completed acquisition of a 609 MW power plant in Rhode Island in 2025. Shell owns ~20 US power plants (mentioned in the case twist). Shell has the natural gas supply chain that could lower our fuel costs.

3. **The activist threat is URGENT.** He's at 9%. Once he hits 10%, it's a boardroom war. A sale announcement would make the stock jump immediately, and the activist can't fight a deal that pays shareholders a premium.

4. **If a full sale is too aggressive**, a JV with Shell (upstream integration) COMBINED with a data center co-location partnership (downstream via Option 3) gives the best of both worlds. This mirrors exactly what Talen Energy has done.

### Final Recommendation:
**Primary: Sell to Shell at a 25-30% premium (~$25-26 billion EV)**
**Alternative: JV with Shell for fuel supply + JV with a data center company for co-location at nuclear/gas plants**

## 7) REAL-WORLD COMPARABLE COMPANIES & JUDGE MATCHING

### Top 5 Companies Sharing Our Case Company's Profile

Our case company profile: Mid-size IPP, PJM-focused, ~13 GW capacity, nuclear + gas + coal, $20B market cap, 30X EV/EBITDA, activist pressure, data center demand opportunity.

| # | Company | Ticker | Why It Matches | Market Cap |
|---|---------|--------|----------------|------------|
| 1 | **Talen Energy** | TLN | PJM-focused IPP, nuclear (Susquehanna 2.2 GW) + gas + coal, ~13 GW capacity, AWS data center deal, aggressive growth strategy, "flywheel" model | ~$16-18B |
| 2 | **Vistra Corp** | VST | Largest US IPP (~41 GW), PJM + ERCOT presence, nuclear fleet (Energy Harbor), coal/gas/solar mix, 30X+ forward multiple, data center focus | ~$50B+ |
| 3 | **Constellation Energy** | CEG | Largest US nuclear fleet, PJM-heavy, Microsoft co-location deal to restart Three Mile Island, premium AI/nuclear multiple | ~$70B+ |
| 4 | **NRG Energy** | NRG | IPP with PJM assets, retail electricity, coal-to-gas transition, ~20 GW | ~$20B |
| 5 | **Calpine** (now owned by Constellation, 2025 acquisition) | - | Was a major PJM/ERCOT gas-focused IPP, ~26 GW natural gas fleet, recently acquired | Was ~$16B |

**Sources:** Talen Energy investor filings, Vistra Corp 8-K filings (Dec 2025), Constellation Energy press releases.

### Judges' Companies Analysis (Pages 10-22 of Handbook)

| Judge | Company | Industry | Match Level |
|-------|---------|----------|-------------|
| **Darren Olagues** | **Talen Energy** (Chief Dev. Officer) | PJM-focused IPP, nuclear+gas+coal | **HIGHEST MATCH** |
| **Gabe Nacht** | **Switch, Inc.** (former CFO) | Data center operator | **HIGH** (downstream target expertise) |
| **Mark Wrzyszczynski** | **Shell** (former engineer/manager) | Oil major, explicitly named in case twist | **HIGH** (upstream buyer expertise) |
| **Christopher Paulsen** | **USA Compression** (SVP/CFO) | Natural gas compression services | **MEDIUM** (gas infrastructure) |
| **Bryan Sheffield** | **Formentera Partners / Parsley Energy** | E&P, energy-focused investment | **MEDIUM** (energy M&A expertise) |
| **Michael LaMotte** | **Guggenheim Securities** | Energy investment banking | **MEDIUM** (deal structuring) |
| **James Wicklund** | **Stephens Inc.** (retired) | Energy investment banking | **MEDIUM** (energy finance) |
| **Blainey Maguire Hess** | **Maguire Oil Company** | Independent E&P | LOW |
| **Bill Hackett** | **WCM Resources / Portal 2 Energy** | Land management, renewables | LOW |
| **Brian Tolson** | **Equitas Energy Partners** | Petroleum landman | LOW |
| **Kathryn Walker Francis** | **KEW Drilling/Minerals/Exploration** | Oil & gas E&P | LOW |
| **Neil Basu** | **SMU Professor** (former Pioneer) | Academic/E&P geology | LOW |

### KEY INSIGHT FOR PRESENTATION:
**Darren Olagues from Talen Energy is THE most relevant judge.** Talen is essentially the real-world version of our case company. Referencing the Talen-AWS nuclear data center deal as a model will resonate with him. Also, **Gabe Nacht** (Switch data center CFO) will appreciate any sophisticated data center acquisition analysis, and **Mark Wrzyszczynski** (Shell veteran) will understand the upstream integration thesis.

## 8) ARE THE FOUR COMPARABLE COMPANIES A GOOD MATCH?

| Company | Ticker | Match? | Why |
|---------|--------|--------|-----|
| **Talen Energy** | TLN | **YES — BEST MATCH** | PJM-focused IPP, nuclear (2.2 GW Susquehanna) + gas + coal. ~13 GW fleet post-acquisitions. AWS data center deal. Same activist shareholder dynamics (emerged from bankruptcy). Explicitly mentioned in the case. |
| **Vistra Corp** | VST | **YES — GOOD MATCH** | Largest US IPP, ~41 GW, PJM+ERCOT, nuclear fleet (Energy Harbor), coal/gas mix. Similar strategy of leveraging nuclear for data centers. However, MUCH larger than our company (~3X market cap). |
| **Constellation Energy** | CEG | **YES — PARTIAL MATCH** | Largest nuclear fleet, PJM-focused. BUT Constellation is primarily nuclear/clean energy and trades at even higher premiums. Much larger. Good benchmark for nuclear valuation. |
| **NRG Energy** | NRG | **YES — GOOD MATCH** | IPP with PJM assets, ~$20B market cap (closest in size), coal-to-gas transition. More retail-focused than our company, but comparable scale and region. |

**Conclusion:** All four are valid comparables. **Talen Energy is the closest mirror** to our case company in almost every dimension.

## 9) REAL-WORLD TARGETS FOR EACH OPTION

### Option 1: Data Center Company for Downstream Integration

**Target: Applied Digital (APLD)**
- Publicly traded on NASDAQ
- Designs, develops, and operates data center infrastructure focused on HPC and AI
- Market cap: ~$6-8 billion (fluctuating)
- Why: Smaller than Equinix/DLR (which are too large at $80B+), focused specifically on AI/HPC data centers, actively building out new facilities
- Rationale: A $20B IPP could realistically acquire a $5-8B data center developer, financed with a stock+cash deal

**Alternative: Cipher Mining (CIFR)** — Bitcoin/AI data center operator, smaller scale (~$2-3B), PJM-proximate facilities

### Option 2: Upstream Sale/Integration

**Energy Company Buyer: Shell plc (SHEL)**
- Explicitly named in the case twist
- Already owns ~20 US power plants and growing
- Completed acquisition of a 609 MW CCGT plant in Rhode Island (2025)
- Has the balance sheet (~$330B market cap) to absorb a $20-25B acquisition
- Natural gas supply chain synergies with our gas plants

**Natural Gas Company Partner (for Shell's fuel supply): EQT Corporation (EQT)**
- Largest US natural gas producer
- Headquartered in Pittsburgh, PA — right in PJM territory
- Market cap: ~$25-30B
- Produces ~6 Bcf/day from Appalachian Basin (Marcellus/Utica shale)
- Could provide below-market gas supply to Shell's newly acquired power fleet
- **This three-way integration (EQT gas → Shell fueling → Our power plants) creates a complete value chain**

### Option 3: JV Partners

**Oil Company for Upstream JV: ExxonMobil (XOM)**
- Explicitly named in the case twist
- Has large natural gas holdings (XTO Energy subsidiary)
- ~$460B market cap — can easily fund a JV
- Seeking to enter the power space per the case twist
- JV structure: Exxon provides gas at cost, our IPP operates the plants, profit split 50/50

**Data Center Company for Downstream JV: Equinix (EQIX)**
- World's largest data center REIT, ~$88B market cap
- 260+ data centers in 72 metros across 33 countries
- Heavy PJM presence (Northern Virginia hub, the US epicenter for data centers)
- JV structure: Our IPP builds co-located generation, Equinix builds the data center, long-term PPA at $80-100/MWh
- **Real-world precedent:** Talen Energy + Amazon Web Services co-location at Susquehanna nuclear plant

## 10) METRICS VALIDATION — CAN THESE FORMULAS BE USED?

**YES.** All 15 formulas in the summary table are valid and can be used. Here's the validation with the Excel data:

| # | Formula | Validated? | Notes |
|---|---------|-----------|-------|
| 1 | Total Capex = $/kW × MW ÷ 1,000 | ✅ | New CCGT: $1,250/kW × 550 MW = $687.5M |
| 2 | Capital/MW = Capex × 1,000 ÷ MW | ✅ | Inverse of #1 |
| 3 | Construction Time = Direct input | ✅ | 24 months for builds |
| 4 | Annual MWh = MW × CF × 8,760 | ✅ | CCGT build: 550 × 0.70 × 8,760 = 3,372,600 MWh |
| 5 | Capacity Factor = Direct input | ✅ | From Excel data |
| 6 | Fuel Cost = Heat Rate × Fuel Price ÷ 1,000 | ✅ | CCGT: 6,150 × $3.75 ÷ 1,000 = $23.06/MWh |
| 7 | Total Op Cost = Fuel + Var O&M + Carbon | ✅ | Carbon = 720 lb/MWh × $20/ton ÷ 2,000 = $7.20/MWh |
| 8 | LCOE = (Capex × CRF + Fixed O&M) ÷ MWh + Variable | ✅ | Standard formula |
| 9 | Carbon Emissions = lb/MWh × MWh ÷ 2,000 | ✅ | Converts to tons/year |
| 10 | WACC = 0.6 × 0.08 × (1-0.4) + 0.4 × 0.12 = 7.68% | ✅ | After-tax debt cost |
| 11 | NPV = -Capex + Σ(FCF ÷ (1+WACC)^t) | ✅ | Standard DCF |
| 12 | IRR = Solve for rate where NPV = 0 | ✅ | Standard IRR |
| 13 | Payback = Capex ÷ Annual FCF | ✅ | Simple payback |
| 14 | Annual FCF = EBITDA × (1-T) + Depreciation × T | ✅ | Tax shield formula |
| 15 | FCF/Share = FCF ÷ 45M shares | ✅ | Per-share metric |

**IMPORTANT FOR CASE TWIST:** These formulas were designed for plant-level analysis (Round 1). For the Case Twist, you'll ALSO need M&A valuation metrics:
- **Acquisition Premium** = Offer Price ÷ Current Price - 1
- **Pro Forma EV/EBITDA** = Combined EV ÷ Combined EBITDA
- **Accretion/Dilution** = (New EPS - Old EPS) ÷ Old EPS
- **Pro Forma FCF/Share** = Combined FCF ÷ New Share Count

## 11) DATA SOURCES VALIDATION

**YES, all five data sources are valid and useful.** Here's how each applies:

| Source | What It Gives You | Use For |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| **NREL ATB** | Capex, O&M, Heat Rates, LCOE by technology | Validating the Excel assumptions; benchmarking build costs |
| **EIA Form 923** | Plant-level generation, capacity factors, fuel consumption | Verifying real-world capacity factors for comparable plants |
| **EPA eGRID** | Emissions and heat rates by plant | Carbon cost calculations; comparing fuel types |
| **PJM Data Miner** | Locational marginal prices (LMPs), capacity auction prices | Revenue modeling; current PJM market prices ($269-333/MW-day in recent auctions) |
| **EIA Natural Gas** | Henry Hub gas prices | Fuel cost assumptions; sensitivity analysis |

**Additional recommended sources for the Case Twist specifically:**

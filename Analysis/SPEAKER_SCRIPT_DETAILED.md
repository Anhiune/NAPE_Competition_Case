## SLIDE 1 — TITLE SLIDE
### *"Strategic Evaluation of Generation Options for SMU/NAPE"*
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~45 seconds**

---

**What to say:**

> *"Good morning / Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for having us.*
>
> *My name is Anh Bui, and I'm joined today by my teammates Minh Nguyen and Cuong Nguyen.*
>
> *Today, we're going to walk you through our team's answer to this case: How should a mid-sized power company grow its business given rising demand from AI and data centers — and how do you do it in a way that is financially smart, operationally realistic, and competitive?*
>
> *We looked at three options: Build a brand-new power plant, Buy an existing one, or Partner with a data center through a co-location agreement.*
>
> *We used the case data, the Excel model, and real industry research to compare all three — and we'll show you not just what we recommend, but WHY the numbers support it.*
>
> *Let's get started."*

---
**Transition:** *"First, let me give you a quick picture of the business we're working with."*

## SLIDE 2 — INTRO TO BUSINESS & CURRENT CHALLENGES
### *"Power generation developer/operator serving hyperscalers and data centers"*
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should know (don't read this — just understand it):**
- This company is a mid-sized Independent Power Producer, or IPP. Think of it like a freelance factory that makes electricity and sells it on the open market — not a regular utility that bills your house.
- It already operates gas plants, nuclear, and solar. It serves big tech companies — called "hyperscalers" — like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft's cloud divisions.
- These tech companies are building massive AI data centers that run 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. They need enormous, uninterrupted electricity supplies.
- The company has roughly 13,000 megawatts of capacity — that's enough to power millions of homes.

**What to say:**

> *"So who is this business?*
>
> *At its core, this is a power company that builds and runs power plants and sells electricity to large industrial customers — especially hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud.*
>
> *These companies are building massive AI campuses. A single AI data center can use as much electricity as a small city. And they need that power every hour, every day — no outages allowed.*
>
> *Using the case's Excel model, we can see what this company already owns and operates:*
> - *The existing 550-megawatt gas plant generates about 3.4 terawatt-hours of electricity per year.*
> - *A new 550-megawatt gas plant would produce about 2.9 terawatt-hours.*
> - *The 800-megawatt nuclear unit generates 6.5 terawatt-hours — that's the most by far, because nuclear runs almost all the time at a 92% capacity factor.*
> - *And a 250-megawatt solar project produces about 1.5 terawatt-hours per year.*
>
> *So the company already knows how to run gas, nuclear, and solar — but each has very different costs, carbon footprints, and roles in the portfolio.*
>
> *Now, what challenges does this company face right now?*
>
> *Three big ones:*
>
> *Number one — Demand is outpacing grid growth. Tech companies need gigawatts of new power, but the grid is not growing fast enough. The company must act.*
>
> *Number two — Decarbonization pressure. Gas plants emit around 875 pounds of CO₂ per megawatt-hour. As carbon pricing comes into effect, that cost goes straight to the bottom line. AI firms want clean power — not just cheap power.*
>
> *Number three — Capital and execution constraints. The case sets a cost of debt at 8%, cost of equity at 12%, and a 60/40 debt-to-equity structure. That means large builds are expensive and every month of delay costs money.*
>
> *These three pressures shape everything we're about to show you."*

---
**Transition:** *"With that context in mind, I'll hand it to Minh, who will walk through how each of the three options stacks up financially."*

## SLIDE 3 — BUILD (Financial Analysis)
### *"550 MW CCGT — Build from scratch"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- CCGT stands for "Combined Cycle Gas Turbine" — this is the most efficient type of gas-burning power plant available today. It uses the hot exhaust from one turbine to power a second turbine, making it roughly twice as efficient as a simple gas engine.
- Capacity Factor (CF): This is the percentage of time the plant actually runs versus how much it theoretically could run. A 60% CF means the plant runs at full output 60% of 8,760 hours per year.
- 2.89 TWh = 550 MW × 60% × 8,760 hours ÷ 1,000
- Capex of $1,150/kW → 550,000 kW × $1,150 = ~$633 million
- PJM is the power market covering 13 US states. Think of it like a stock exchange, but instead of buying shares, power plants sell electricity by the hour. Prices fluctuate every day.

**What to say:**

> *"Let's start with the Build option — building a brand-new 550-megawatt gas-fired power plant.*
>
> *Using the case's assumptions: at a 60% capacity factor, this plant would generate about 2.89 terawatt-hours of electricity per year. Gas is still the backbone of American power — it provides 40 to 45% of US electricity — so demand for dispatchable gas generation is real.*
>
> *The total construction cost is roughly 633 million dollars, based on the case's $1,150 per kilowatt estimate. That is a big number.*
>
> *But here's the financial challenge: the returns on this investment depend heavily on the PJM energy market, which is volatile. Prices can swing dramatically from season to season, and capacity auction prices are uncertain. Unless the company secures a long-term power purchase agreement before building, it is fully exposed to that price risk.*
>
> *From a competitive standpoint — Build delivers reliable, dispatchable power, but it has a major weakness: it burns gas, which means it emits roughly 875 pounds of CO₂ per megawatt-hour. And today's data center buyers — Microsoft, Google, Amazon — are actively pursuing low-carbon partnerships. They want zero-carbon or near-zero-carbon power. A new merchant gas plant is not what they want to sign a 20-year contract for.*
>
> *So the Build option is viable from a pure reliability standpoint, but it comes with high capital cost, market price risk, and a weaker ESG story that could drive away the most valuable customers."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let's look at an alternative — what if instead of building something new, you buy something that already exists?"*

---

## SLIDE 4 — BUY (Financial Analysis)
### *"Acquire an existing 550 MW CCGT — ~$450 million"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- The Buy option means acquiring an existing power plant that is already running. You skip the 2-year construction timeline.
- At a 70% capacity factor (slightly higher because existing plants are already optimized): 550 MW × 70% × 8,760 hours ÷ 1,000 = 3.37 TWh/year
- O&M stands for "Operations and Maintenance" — the ongoing cost to keep a plant running. Older plants cost more.
- LNG = Liquefied Natural Gas. The US is exporting more LNG overseas, which drives up domestic gas prices — hurting power plant margins.
- Nuclear provides 18-20% of US electricity but almost never goes up for sale because it's so valuable. So buying a nuclear plant is extremely rare.

**What to say:**

> *"The Buy option means we skip construction entirely and simply purchase an existing 550-megawatt gas plant for approximately $450 million — which is less than the Build cost.*
>
> *The big advantage is speed. You buy it, you own it, you're generating cash flow almost immediately. At a 70% capacity factor, this plant produces 3.37 terawatt-hours per year — even more than a brand-new build, because existing plants are already running efficiently.*
>
> *But here's where it gets complicated.*
>
> *Older assets mean higher maintenance costs and declining efficiency over time. And the carbon problem doesn't go away — you're still burning gas at 875 pounds of CO₂ per megawatt-hour. As carbon pricing increases, those emissions become a direct financial cost.*
>
> *There's also the gas price risk. America is exporting more and more liquefied natural gas overseas. That increases domestic demand for gas, which pushes prices higher. Higher gas prices mean lower margins for any gas plant.*
>
> *Strategically, Buy is the fastest way to add megawatts — but it's not scalable. There are very few high-quality gas or nuclear plants sitting on the market near major data center hubs. And nuclear plants — which would be the ideal acquisition — almost never come up for sale because utilities hold onto them.*
>
> *In short: Buy gives you fast capacity, but you're locked into aging, carbon-exposed assets with limited optionality."*

---
**Transition:** *"Neither Build nor Buy gives us what the market actually wants. So let's talk about the option that does — Partner."*

---

## SLIDE 5 — PARTNER (Financial Analysis)
### *"Co-location JV with hyperscalers — long-term PPA structure"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- "Co-location" means you build the power plant physically next to the data center — they are on the same piece of land. This means power goes directly to the customer without touching the public grid.
- JV = Joint Venture. The power company and the data center company both put in money and share the profits.
- PPA = Power Purchase Agreement. A long-term contract (15-20 years) where the data center agrees to buy electricity at a fixed price. This is the opposite of selling into the volatile PJM market.
- IRR = Internal Rate of Return. This is the actual percentage return on the investment. If your WACC is 7.68%, you need IRR to be higher than that to create value.
- 415 TWh/year = global data center electricity use. The US accounts for 45% of that. It's growing 12% per year.

**What to say:**

> *"Now here's the Partner option — and this is where the strategy gets really interesting.*
>
> *Instead of building a plant and hoping to sell power on the open market, you build a plant specifically to power a data center — and you sell it directly to them through a long-term contract called a PPA, or Power Purchase Agreement. Think of it as locking in a customer for 15 to 20 years before you even break ground.*
>
> *Financially, this changes everything. That long-term contract means stable, predictable cash flow year after year — no more guessing what PJM prices will be tomorrow. And because the hyperscaler often co-funds part of the construction cost, you need less capital up front, which directly boosts your Internal Rate of Return compared to a pure build.*
>
> *From a market alignment standpoint: global data centers already use 415 terawatt-hours of electricity per year. The US holds 45% of that. The Northern Virginia area — which sits right inside the PJM market — is the single largest data center cluster in the world. These companies are already signing long-term deals with power producers. They already partnered with Constellation Energy to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear plant. Talen Energy already has a co-location deal with Amazon Web Services at their nuclear plant in Pennsylvania.*
>
> *The trend is clear, the demand is there, and the playbook already exists.*
>
> *Partner gives the company stable revenue, better returns, lower PJM exposure, and a credible ESG story — because you can blend gas with solar or even nuclear to deliver a low-carbon power package.*
>
> *This is the strongest option financially."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now, knowing the financial picture, let's look at how each option actually holds up when you try to execute it in the real world. I'll hand it over to Cuong."*

---

## SLIDE 6 — BUILD (Operational & Execution)
### *"Industry build time: 24–30 months; high capital exposure"*
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- COD = Commercial Operation Date. The day the plant starts generating and selling electricity. Until that day, you're spending money with zero revenue coming in.
- IDC = Interest During Construction. Every month the plant is being built, you owe interest on your construction loans. That's a cost that shows up before a single dollar of revenue.
- The case assumes 24 months of construction time, but real-world data shows 24–36 months is more common due to supply chain issues and permitting.
- Carbon cost from the case model = 720 lb/MWh × $20/ton ÷ 2,000 = $7.20/MWh. This is a real additional cost that reduces your margin.

**What to say:**

> *"Let's talk about what actually happens when you try to execute these options — starting with Build.*
>
> *First, time. Industry data shows that constructing a combined cycle gas plant takes 24 to 30 months from the start of construction. And that's if everything goes smoothly. Permitting delays, equipment shortages, labor constraints — all of which are real right now in the US — can push that to 36 months or longer.*
>
> *Every month the plant isn't running is a month you're paying loan interest but earning zero revenue. The case sets cost of debt at 8% on hundreds of millions of dollars. That adds up very fast.*
>
> *Until the day the plant opens — what's called the Commercial Operation Date — you have full cost exposure and zero revenue. You're also fully exposed to whatever PJM prices end up being when you finally do open. If prices drop, your revenue assumptions fall apart.*
>
> *And operationally, at a 60% capacity factor, this is a mid-merit plant — it doesn't run all the time. That means higher long-term fuel and carbon costs per unit of electricity generated compared to a baseload nuclear plant.*
>
> *Bottom line: Build requires a strong balance sheet, a high risk tolerance, and a lot of patience. It only makes sense if you have a customer locked in before you pour the first concrete."*

---
**Transition:** *"So what about Buy — does skipping construction solve those execution problems?"*

---

## SLIDE 7 — BUY (Operational & Execution)
### *"Inherit existing fleet — mixed age, limited control"*
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- Forced outage rate = how often a plant unexpectedly shuts down. Older plants shut down more often. Each unplanned outage means lost revenue and emergency maintenance costs.
- R&M capex = Repair and Maintenance capital expenditure. Older assets need more frequent, expensive repairs.
- The case shows the existing portfolio includes older coal and gas plants — these are real operational liabilities.
- Nuclear life extensions = that's how most nuclear capacity gets added in the US. Not new plants — just keeping old ones running longer. And that process is slow and expensive.

**What to say:**

> *"Buy avoids the 24-to-36-month construction timeline — that part is true. But it replaces construction risk with a different kind of risk: asset inheritance.*
>
> *When you buy an existing fleet, you get whatever condition those plants are in. The case shows a mixed portfolio of older coal and gas assets. Older plants fail more often — what the industry calls 'forced outages' — and they need more repairs. That means your maintenance budget is unpredictable from year to year.*
>
> *You also have no control over where the plant sits, how it was built, or how fuel-efficient it is. You inherit someone else's design choices.*
>
> *And market availability is another problem. High-quality, efficient gas plants near major data center hubs rarely come up for sale. The best assets don't hit the open market — utilities hold onto them. If you do find something, you're likely paying a premium in a competitive auction against other buyers who want the same thing.*
>
> *Nuclear is even harder. 18 to 20% of US electricity comes from nuclear, and growth in that sector mostly happens through life extensions — keeping existing plants running longer — not through new builds or acquisitions. So if you're hoping to buy a nuclear plant, the supply is extremely limited.*
>
> *And once you buy, you're locked in. No design control. No ability to choose your carbon intensity. Whatever you bought is what you operate.*
>
> *Buy is the simplest execution play on day one, but operationally, the long-term profile is set in stone the moment you sign the acquisition agreement."*

---
**Transition:** *"Compare that with Partner — where you actually get to design the asset around the customer's needs."*

---

## SLIDE 8 — PARTNER / CO-LOCATION (Operational & Execution)
### *"100–200 MW modular blocks; behind-the-meter design"*
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- Behind-the-meter (BTM) = the power plant is connected directly to the data center's electrical system. The electricity never goes onto the public grid. This means no PJM transmission fees, no interconnection queue delays (which can take 5+ years in some cases), and no congestion costs.
- In-front-of-meter (FITM) = the power goes to the grid first, then to the customer. More grid risk, more costs.
- The case explicitly allows both designs — this means the company has flexibility.
- JV (Joint Venture) structure: each party owns a share of the project, shares the capital cost, and splits the revenue or cost savings.
- EPC = Engineering, Procurement, and Construction — the total execution cost. Smaller modular builds reduce this risk.

**What to say:**

> *"Now let's look at how Partner actually works operationally — and this is where it gets very different from Build or Buy.*
>
> *In the Partner model, you're not building a single massive 550-megawatt plant and hoping someone buys the output. Instead, you build in blocks — 100 to 200 megawatts at a time — sized precisely for one data center campus.*
>
> *And critically, you can go behind the meter. That means the power plant and the data center are physically connected. The electricity flows directly from one to the other — it never touches the public grid. That eliminates PJM transmission fees, avoids the interconnection queue — which can take years — and removes congestion risk entirely.*
>
> *The case explicitly says behind-the-meter and in-front-of-meter are both allowed. Behind-the-meter wins on execution speed.*
>
> *Because the data center partner has already signed a long-term contract, your dispatch schedule is predictable. You know exactly how much power you need to produce every day. That makes operations simpler and more reliable.*
>
> *Smaller modular builds also reduce engineering and construction risk. If you're building 150 megawatts instead of 550, you have fewer moving parts, shorter timelines, and lower risk of budget overruns.*
>
> *And the data center company sharing the capital cost means the IPP doesn't have to borrow as much — which is huge given the 8% cost of debt in this case.*
>
> *Yes, there is more coordination upfront. But once the partnership is structured, long-term operational risk is actually lower than either Build or Buy — because revenue is contracted and the load is guaranteed."*

---
**Transition:** *"So what does a real Partner deal actually look like? I'll hand back to Anh to walk you through the illustrative structure."*

---

## SLIDE 9 — HOW PARTNER LOOKS IN PRACTICE
### *"150 MW CCGT + 50 MW Solar | 15–20 yr PPA | Shared Capex"*
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- This slide is where you make it real and concrete. Don't be vague — give specific numbers.
- The illustrative example: 150 MW gas + 50 MW solar serving one AI campus = 200 MW total. The gas runs 24/7 for baseload reliability. The solar runs during the day, reducing gas consumption and improving the ESG profile.
- Three customer verticals: AI hyperscalers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft), Enterprise HPC (universities, defense, finance), Renewable-mandated hubs (states like Virginia, California that require data centers to buy clean power).
- Real-world precedent: Talen Energy + Amazon Web Services at Susquehanna nuclear plant in Pennsylvania. That is the model.
- One of the judges — Darren Olagues — is the Chief Development Officer at Talen Energy. He has personally worked on this exact type of deal. Reference it confidently.

**What to say:**

> *"Here's what a real Partner deal looks like — using numbers directly from the case.*
>
> *We size it to one hyperscale campus: 150 megawatts of gas power for 24/7 baseload reliability, plus 50 megawatts of solar to reduce daytime gas use and lower the carbon footprint.*
>
> *The contract is 15 to 20 years, with pricing based on the case inputs — the capex assumptions from the Excel model, 3% annual O&M escalation, the heat rate and carbon cost assumptions, and a 60/40 debt-to-equity structure.*
>
> *The hyperscaler co-funds construction capital. The IPP — this company — owns and operates the assets. That shared investment structure dramatically improves the Internal Rate of Return versus building on your own.*
>
> *The behind-the-meter design avoids the PJM interconnection delays that the case highlights. Instead of waiting years to get grid connection, you plug directly into the data center.*
>
> *Now, who are the customers for this model? Three groups:*
>
> *First — AI and hyperscale campuses. These are Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and Meta. They need hundreds of megawatts of 24/7 clean power and growing at 12% per year. They are already doing deals exactly like this — the Talen-AWS deal at Susquehanna nuclear is the real-world proof.*
>
> *Second — Enterprise and government HPC (high-performance computing). Think defense agencies, financial modeling firms, and major research universities. These are smaller but extremely reliability-sensitive customers.*
>
> *Third — Renewable-mandated hubs. Some states are starting to require that data centers source low-carbon power. Solar alone cannot run 24 hours a day. But a blended gas plus solar package can — and that's exactly what this model delivers.*
>
> *Across all three segments, the Partner model scales cleanly. You build one 200-megawatt campus. Then the next. Then the next. Each project is self-financing through the PPA."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let's bring in the forecasting numbers to show you what this actually means in terms of output, capital, and financial returns. I'll hand to Minh."*

---

## SLIDE 10 — FORECASTING: ENERGY OUTPUT & CAPITAL INVESTMENT
### *"Annual Generation (GWh/year) | Total Capital Required"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- 1 GWh = 1,000 MWh = 1,000,000 kWh. Think of 1 GWh as roughly powering 90,000 US homes for a day.
- Co-located nuclear produces 6,447 GWh/year because nuclear runs at 92% capacity factor almost constantly.
- Build New CCGT produces 3,373 GWh/year at 70% CF.
- Capital: Partner requires only ~$100M from the IPP because the data center co-funds the rest. Build New requires $688M. Acquire nuclear is $3 billion+ because nuclear plants are extremely expensive to buy.
- Key takeaway: Partner produces HIGH energy at LOW capital cost to us. That's the key message.

**What to say:**

> *"Let's look at what the numbers actually say — starting with energy output and capital needed.*
>
> *For annual energy generation:*
> - *Co-Located Nuclear — our Partner option with nuclear — produces 6,447 gigawatt-hours per year. That's because nuclear runs at a 92% capacity factor. It barely ever turns off.*
> - *Build New CCGT produces 3,373 gigawatt-hours per year at a 70% capacity factor.*
> - *Nuclear naturally wins on output. Nearly double a gas plant.*
>
> *Now let's look at what each option costs to get there.*
>
> - *Partner requires only about $100 million from our company — because the data center partner co-funds a large portion of the capital. It's shared.*
> - *Build New CCGT requires $688 million — all from our balance sheet.*
> - *Acquiring a nuclear plant costs approximately $3 billion — because nuclear assets are so scarce and valuable that sellers command a massive premium.*
>
> *Here's the most important takeaway from this slide: the Partner option delivers high energy output at the lowest capital cost to the IPP. You get more for less. That's the definition of a good return.*
>
> *And remember — the data center is co-funding that construction. So the hyperscaler customer is literally helping you build your own asset. That's a very powerful structure."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let's look at the cost side — specifically, the levelized cost of electricity, and the net present value of each option."*

---

## SLIDE 11 — FORECASTING: LCOE & NPV
### *"LCOE Component Breakdown | Net Present Value at 8% WACC"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- LCOE = Levelized Cost of Energy. This is the all-in cost per megawatt-hour to produce electricity, accounting for capital, fuel, and O&M over the plant's life. It's the "true cost" of a power option.
- WACC = Weighted Average Cost of Capital = 7.68% based on the case (60% debt × 8% × (1-40% tax) + 40% equity × 12%). This is the minimum return needed to satisfy investors.
- NPV = Net Present Value. Positive NPV means the investment is worth MORE than it costs. Negative NPV means it destroys value.
- Co-Located Nuclear NPV = $1,164 million — enormous positive value.
- Build New CCGT NPV = $37 million — barely positive, barely clears the hurdle.
- Acquire Nuclear NPV = -$448 million — destroys value. Too expensive relative to remaining life.

**What to say:**

> *"Now let's look at cost and value — starting with the Levelized Cost of Energy, or LCOE.*
>
> *LCOE is the fully-loaded cost to produce one megawatt-hour of electricity across the lifetime of the project. Think of it as the break-even price — if the market price is higher than your LCOE, you make money.*
>
> *For the Partner model with co-located nuclear: the LCOE is very low. Why? Because nuclear has almost no fuel cost — uranium is cheap per unit of electricity. The capital cost is split with the data center partner. And with a 92% capacity factor, you're spreading your fixed costs over massive output.*
>
> *For Build New CCGT: fuel is the biggest cost — about $25 per megawatt-hour. Capital recovery adds another roughly $30 per megawatt-hour. So the all-in cost is much higher.*
>
> *For Acquire Nuclear: the capital cost per megawatt-hour is enormous because you paid $3 billion for the plant. Even though the operating cost is low, you can never recover that acquisition price efficiently.*
>
> *Now Net Present Value — which tells us the actual value each option creates.*
>
> *At our WACC of 7.68%:*
> - *Co-Located Nuclear has an NPV of positive $1,164 million. That's 1.16 BILLION dollars of value created. Extraordinary.*
> - *Build New CCGT has an NPV of positive $37 million. It barely clears the hurdle. It works, but just barely.*
> - *Acquire Nuclear has an NPV of negative $448 million. It destroys shareholder value. You paid too much.*
>
> *The conclusion from this slide is crystal clear: Partner is the only option that creates substantial, meaningful value for shareholders."*

---
**Transition:** *"And when you look at cash flows over time, the story gets even clearer."*

---

## SLIDE 12 — FORECASTING: FREE CASH FLOW
### *"10-Year Free Cash Flow Forecast by Option"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~60 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- FCF = Free Cash Flow. After paying all bills, interest, and capex — this is the cash the company actually has left. It's what can be paid to shareholders or reinvested.
- Partner stays flat and strong: $170–185M per year for 10+ years. Stable and predictable.
- Build CCGT declines over time: starts at ~$60M but drops to ~$40M as gas prices and carbon costs eat into margins.
- Acquire Nuclear collapses: starts at ~$165M but falls to just ~$20M because heavy debt service from the $3B acquisition crushes the cash flow.

**What to say:**

> *"Free Cash Flow is the purest measure of a business — it's the actual cash left over after you've paid for everything: operations, debt interest, and maintenance capital.*
>
> *Over a 10-year period:*
>
> - *The Partner model stays strong and stable at $170 to $185 million per year. The long-term contracted revenue means you know what's coming in. This is what makes investors — and analysts — comfortable.*
>
> - *Build New CCGT starts at around $60 million per year but declines to around $40 million. As gas prices rise and carbon costs increase, the margins get squeezed.*
>
> - *Acquire Nuclear starts at $165 million in the early years — looks great. But the $3 billion acquisition price means massive debt service payments. Over time, those debt payments overwhelm the cash inflow, and by year 10, you're down to just $20 million. The debt crushes the model.*
>
> *Across all financial metrics — energy output, LCOE, NPV, and free cash flow — Partner is the winner, and it's not close.*
>
> *Partner is the option that sustains shareholder returns year after year — which is exactly what this business needs."*

---
**Transition:** *"Finally, let's look at net income — what survives after tax and depreciation."*

---

## SLIDE 13 — NET PROFIT AFTER TAX & DEPRECIATION
### *"Steady-State Annual Net Income — Years 7 to 20"*
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~60 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- Net income = Revenue minus all costs, interest, taxes, and depreciation. This is the "bottom line."
- Depreciation is a non-cash accounting charge, but it reduces taxable income (a tax benefit called the MACRS tax shield in the case).
- Co-Located Nuclear steady state: $225M/year. The 92% capacity factor and contracted revenue produce enormously stable earnings.
- Acquire Existing CCGT and Build New CCGT both stabilize around $70M/year — much lower because merchant gas exposure limits upside.
- 3.2x = $225M ÷ $70M. The nuclear Partner option makes 3.2 times more annual profit than gas alternatives.

**What to say:**

> *"Looking at steady-state net income — what the business earns per year once things have stabilized — from years 7 through 20:*
>
> - *Co-Located Nuclear delivers approximately $225 million of net income per year. The 92% capacity factor and 20-year contract mean very little variability. The earnings are almost as predictable as a utility.*
>
> - *Both Acquire Existing CCGT and Build New CCGT plateau at roughly $70 million per year. They are constrained by gas market exposure — prices fluctuate, margins fluctuate, income fluctuates.*
>
> *The difference? The Partner nuclear option earns 3.2 times more annual profit than gas alternatives.*
>
> *Why? Two reasons:*
> *First, contracted revenue eliminates the merchant price risk that eats into gas plant margins.*
> *Second, nuclear's near-perfect capacity factor means you earn money almost every hour of every day.*
>
> *This is the financial reality that makes the Partner model not just the best option for this case — but the model that leading companies like Talen Energy, Constellation Energy, and Vistra are already executing in the real world right now.*
>
> *And the judges sitting in front of you today are from those exact companies — this is the direction the industry is moving."*

## SLIDE 14 — RISK ASSESSMENT & SOLUTIONS (Risks 1 & 2)
### *"Single-partner dependence | Complex revenue sharing"*
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- The Partner model is the best option, but it does have risks. Being transparent about risk shows maturity and builds credibility with judges.
- Risk 1: Single-partner dependence. If you co-locate with just one hyperscaler (say, Amazon) and that relationship falls apart — or they go bankrupt — your entire revenue stream is at risk.
- SLA = Service Level Agreement. A legally binding document that spells out exactly what performance is required, what happens if it's not delivered, and how either party can exit.
- Risk 2: Complex revenue sharing. When two companies co-Build a project and share costs and revenues, you need a very clear formula for who gets what. If the formula is unclear or hard to apply, disputes arise.
- Automated revenue-management tools = software that applies the formula automatically in real-time, removing human error and disputes.

**What to say:**

> *"We want to be transparent about the risks in the Partner strategy — because every strategy has them.*
>
> *Risk number one is partner concentration. If the entire 200-megawatt project is tied to one data center customer — say one Amazon AWS campus — then the company is completely dependent on that single relationship. If Amazon renegotiates, cancels, or faces financial trouble, the company loses its entire revenue base for that project.*
>
> *Our solution: diversify. Structure the portfolio so no single data center partner represents more than 30% of contracted revenue. Expand into multiple geographic hubs — not just Northern Virginia, but also other fast-growing markets. Use strong Service Level Agreements with very clear performance expectations and defined exit provisions, so you're legally protected if a partner doesn't perform.*
>
> *Risk number two is revenue-sharing complexity. When two companies co-fund a project and share both costs and revenues, the math of who gets paid what can get complicated very quickly — especially when capacity factors change, when a repair bill shows up, or when the power price index shifts.*
>
> *If partners disagree on the math, it creates disputes that slow down operations and damage the relationship.*
>
> *Our solution: standardize. Build two or three simple, transparent pricing tiers that can be applied to any deal. Then use automated revenue-management software so the formula runs itself in real time — no manual calculation, no disagreements, no delays."*

**Transition:** *"And the third risk involves operations."*

## SLIDE 15 — RISK ASSESSMENT & SOLUTIONS (Risk 3) + CLOSING
### *"Operational misalignment | Final Recommendation"*
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should know:**
- Risk 3: When an energy company and a tech company work together, they have very different cultures. Engineers care about uptime. Tech companies care about agility and speed. Finance teams care about margins. All three groups need to be moving in the same direction, or the JV operations break down.
- OKR = Objectives and Key Results. A management framework used by companies like Google and Amazon to align all teams around shared goals. E.g., "Our shared goal is to achieve 99.99% uptime in Year 1" — everyone in the JV is measured on the same target.
- The closing summary should be clear, confident, and memorable. Land the recommendation with conviction.

**What to say:**

> *"Risk number three is operational misalignment. When a power company and a tech company work together in a joint venture, they speak very different languages.*
>
> *Power engineers think in terms of megawatts, fuel consumption, and forced outage rates. Tech operations teams think in terms of uptime percentage, latency, and server capacity. Finance teams on both sides are tracking different cost centers. If these groups don't share the same goals and reporting rhythm, the partnership slows down. Decisions take too long. Problems don't get fixed. The data center partner gets frustrated.*
>
> *Our solution: align everyone on shared Objectives and Key Results — OKRs. Both the power company and the data center partner agree on the same three to five goals at the start of each quarter. Everyone is measured by the same targets. And we run regular cross-functional leadership meetings — once a month minimum — to surface blockers early, before they become crises.*
>
> *Alignment isn't a one-time thing. It's a process. And you build it with consistent communication.*
>
> *Let me close with a clear summary of what our analysis shows:*
>
> **Build** *is capital-heavy, takes two to three years before you earn a dollar, and leaves you exposed to PJM price swings and carbon costs. It can work, but only with a contracted customer in place before construction starts.*
>
> **Buy** *is fast for megawatts, but you inherit aging assets, fixed carbon exposure, and limited scalability. You get speed at the cost of flexibility.*
>
> **Partner** *is the strongest overall strategy. It aligns directly with hyperscaler demand. It converts volatile merchant exposure into stable, contracted revenue. It requires less capital from the company because the data center co-funds construction. And it scales cleanly as data center campuses grow — campus by campus, region by region.*
>
> *Based on the case assumptions, the Excel model, real-world industry precedent, and the direction the entire power sector is moving, Partner is the clear winner.*
>
> *Thank you very much for your time. We're happy to take any questions."*

## APPENDIX: QUICK-REFERENCE CHEAT SHEET FOR Q&A

| Topic | Quick Answer |
|-------|-------------|
| **Why Partner over Build?** | Lower capital cost, contracted revenue, no PJM merchant risk, faster execution |
| **Why not just Buy nuclear?** | $3B acquisition cost destroys NPV; nuclear plants are too expensive to acquire profitably |
| **What if the hyperscaler cancels?** | Diversify partners, strong SLAs with exit provisions, expand geographically |
| **What's the IRR of Partner?** | Higher than pure Build because of shared capex structure; case WACC is 7.68% |
| **What real company is the data center partner?** | Model follows the Talen Energy + Amazon AWS co-location at Susquehanna nuclear |
| **Why 15–20 year PPA?** | Gives both parties revenue certainty; long enough to recover capital investment |
| **What is PJM?** | The power market covering 13 US states; think of it as the stock exchange for electricity |
| **What does behind-the-meter mean?** | Power plant and data center are on the same site; power never touches the public grid |
| **Who has done this in real life?** | Talen Energy + AWS; Constellation Energy + Microsoft (Three Mile Island restart, 2024) |
| **Why not sell to Shell or ExxonMobil?** | Our presentation focuses on the generating business; a sale could be explored, but this case focuses on internal value creation |

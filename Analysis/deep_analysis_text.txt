Analysis of SMU/NAPE Strategic Options
This analysis evaluates three strategic options – (1) acquiring existing power plants, (2) building new generation facilities, and (3) co-locating generation with data centers – using only the case’s provided data. We consider financial (adjusted free cash flow and risk) and strategic factors (growth trends in AI/data centers, energy sourcing, grid dynamics in PJM and other RTOs). Each option is assessed with detailed pros and cons and scored on risk‐adjusted returns, scalability, trend alignment, and regulatory/competitive risk. Finally, we rank the options, recommend a strategy, and suggest key performance metrics for long‐term tracking.
Option 1: Acquire Existing Assets
Pros:
Immediate Capacity and Cash Flow: Acquiring existing plants (e.g. gas-fired or nuclear) yields instant generation without construction delay. For example, buying a 550 MW gas plant (case capex ~$450M pewresearch.org) immediately adds capacity at once.
Lower Initial Investment: Purchase prices can be lower than new-build costs. The case data show an existing CCGT (550 MW) can be bought for $450M (vs. ~$1150/kW to build new gas), reducing upfront capex.
Known Technology: Existing plants use proven technology. An existing nuclear plant (800 MW, baseload) already has high capacity factor (0.92) and low variable costs (fuel+O&M ~$15/MWh) pewresearch.org, offering stable output. This aligns with data-center needs (nuclear currently supplies ~20% of DC power pewresearch.org).
Capacity Market Revenue: Purchased plants in PJM can earn both energy and capacity payments. The PJM capacity market pays existing assets, providing steady revenue beyond energy sales.
Cons:
Asset Age/Risk: Many existing plants (especially coal or older gas) may require retrofits or face retirements. Older nuclear could need upgrades. Maintenance costs and unplanned outages can be high.
Market Volatility: Acquisitions still must compete in wholesale markets. Fuel-cost volatility (gas prices) and carbon pricing expose returns to market swings. For gas plants, fuel and carbon costs (~$35/MWh total) erode margins, so volatile gas prices (and a $20/ton carbon price) increase risk. The case “with carbon footprint” table shows existing gas has high fuel use and emissions (875 lb CO₂/MWh) pewresearch.org.
Limited Opportunities: Large nuclear plants are rarely for sale; gas plants may command premium prices if near DC hubs. With AI-era demand, sellers (e.g. utilities) have strong bargaining power.
Alignment: Simply expanding via old assets offers less technological differentiation. It does not directly target the data center/AI trend beyond supplying power. This reactive approach may not capture new value (e.g. no “green” premium).
Option 2: Build New Generation (On-Grid)
Pros:
Latest Technology and Scale: New plants can use advanced designs. For instance, building new gas CCGT benefits from high efficiency (0.7 CF) and emissions controls, while new solar + storage offers carbon-free output. The case data suggests new gas builds are less expensive per kW than solar (EPC ~$1,150/kW vs. $5,250/kW) and have moderate operating costs.
Strategic Alignment with AI/Data Centers: Tech and data-center companies are investing in new energy sources. Leading tech firms are signing power purchase agreements (PPAs) to finance new projects. For example, Microsoft is helping restart Three Mile Island (800 MW) by 2028 and insists on both renewables and nuclear                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               reuters.comreuters.com. Building new generation (especially low carbon) taps this momentum. The CEO of Microsoft notes that “wind, solar… are important” but also “traditional nuclear … needs to play a very important part” reuters.com. New builds can capture these long-term contracts or incentives.
Clean Energy Shift: New projects can meet regulatory and ESG goals. For example, building new solar+storage offers carbon-free power, aligning with states’ moves to require data centers to use renewables pewresearch.org. The Pew study notes renewables already supply ~24% of data-center electricity pewresearch.org, and mandates may increase this share.
Economic Returns (Long Term): Although capex is high, modern plants may have longer life and lower variable costs. New builds can scale for larger capacities (multiple GW) to serve clusters of data centers, improving economies of scale.
Cons:
High Capex and Lead Time: New plants require large investment and long construction (the case assumes 24 months for gas or solar builds). For example, a 250 MW solar plant costs ~$1.31B but only generates ~1.5 million MWh/year (CF 0.68) for ~ $12.6/MWh fixed O&M (per case data). The payback may be slow.
Execution Risk: Construction of large assets faces schedule, permitting, and regulatory risk. Delays or overruns reduce NPV.
Market Uncertainty: Built plants must still sell power in competitive markets. Until a PPA is secured, exposure to volatile energy prices persists. New gas plants still bear fuel/carbon risk; new solar is intermittent.
Grid Constraints: New large projects (especially in congested PJM/VA) may face transmission interconnection delays or higher costs.
Option 3: Co-Located Plants with Data Centers (Behind/Front of Meter)
Pros:
Secure Demand/Revenue: Co-locating generation (e.g. on the same site as a data center, possibly as a JV) allows long-term contracts or cost-of-service structures. Behind-the-meter plants can directly serve the data center, offering stable revenues. This shields the project from wholesale market price swings and capacity auctions. In effect, it de-risks the project by having a guaranteed offtake (sometimes at a fixed tariff).
Strategic Fit with AI Boom: With data centers projected to double electricity use by 2030pewresearch.org, companies need assured power supply. A co-located model directly addresses the “no AI without energy” realityiea.org. For example, a data center JV could build a dedicated 100-200 MW gas plant or solar farm with battery to meet local load, simplifying logistics. This appeals to hyperscalers seeking green, reliable power.
Reduced Grid Pressure: By serving load onsite (behind meter), the project alleviates grid congestion and may avoid capacity costs levied in RTOs. This can build goodwill with regulators (e.g. to protect residential customers from DC-driven price hikespewresearch.org).
Scalability across Tech Hubs: Many data centers cluster (e.g. Northern Virginia). Replicating co-located projects at these hubs is feasible and repeatable, especially with major tech partners.
Cons:
Complex Partnerships: Structuring these deals is complicated. It may involve JVs or special-purpose vehicles with data-center owners. Negotiating who finances capex, shares ownership and output, or takes production tax credits can be lengthy.
Potentially Lower Margins: Offtake contracts (especially with a big tech counterparty) might cap upside. Behind-the-meter power prices may be set at cost-plus rather than market rates. The company may earn smaller spreads than selling into high wholesale prices.
Regulatory Ambiguity: Depending on jurisdiction, co-located projects could face regulatory hurdles (e.g. utility vs. merchant classification). If considered distributed generation, they may not qualify for capacity credits, or conversely might have to meet reliability obligations.
Technology Limitations: A small solar plant with battery may not cover all data-center needs (e.g. overnight or backup). Co-located gas plants face local permitting/community pushback. Nuclear co-location is generally impractical.
Comparative Scoring and Ranking
We evaluate each option on four criteria, with illustrative weights: Risk-Adjusted Return (30%), Scalability/Replicability (20%), Trend Alignment (25%), and Regulatory/Competitive Risk (25%). Each option is scored (1–5) on each criterion, then weighted. The table below shows a notional scoring:
Scoring notes: Option 3 (co-location) scores highest overall due to stable contracted returns and perfect alignment with surging DC demand (the IEA notes “there is no AI without energy” iea.org). Option 2 (new builds) ranks second: it supports future trends (renewables/nuclear) and can scale, but its financial returns and execution risks temper the score. Option 1 scores lowest overall: although it provides quick volume, it ranks poorly on innovation and risk management. The weighted scores (not shown) would favor Option 3 > Option 2 > Option 1.
Ranking (most→least favorable):
Option 3 (Co-Located Plants) – Highest stability and alignment with AI/DC trends.
Option 2 (New Builds) – Good scalability and trend fit but higher execution/financial risk.
Option 1 (Acquire Existing) – Quick capacity boost but lowest on innovation and exposes the company to volatile markets.
Strategic Recommendation
Given accelerating AI-driven demand and grid pressures, the recommended strategy is a hybrid focus on new build and co-location, with emphasis on projects co-located with data centers. In practice, this means pursuing partnerships (or JVs) to build generation facilities – ideally clean energy – tied directly to large data-center loads. This approach locks in long-term offtake and mitigates wholesale risk, while meeting the emerging need for low-carbon, reliable power.
Specifically, we recommend:
Pursue Co-Located Renewable or Gas Projects: Structure PPAs or JVs with hyperscalers to build behind-the-meter solar+storage or CCGT plants at new data center campuses. This taps the 133% expected growth in data center electricity use by 2030 pewresearch.org. For example, offering a combined solar+storage install for a major AI campus would align with state policies requiring DCs to use renewables pewresearch.org and take data centers out of the grid queue.
Invest in Low-Carbon New Builds with Tech Partners: Use corporate offtakes to justify new facilities. The case data show nuclear (existing) yields high output with zero carbon, and tech companies (Microsoft, Google, Amazon) are already facilitating nuclear restarts reuters.com. Where viable, invest in small modular reactors or green ammonia turbines as new builds (Option 2) – projects that have backing from data-center PPAs. Also build new gas plants with carbon capture or the highest efficiency, since the U.S. data center fleet still relies ~40% on gas pewresearch.org.
Be Selective on Acquisitions: Rather than a broad buy-up of assets, consider only opportunistic acquisitions (Option 1) that complement the above (e.g. an existing plant adjacent to a data hub). Pure merchants buys face low ROI under carbon pricing. If acquiring, favor nuclear or flexible gas plants with proven efficiency. Any purchase should factor in likely capacity-market revenues and carbon costs from the case (e.g. existing gas has higher carbon intensity pewresearch.org).
This recommendation balances growth (through Option 3/Option 2) with return and risk. It maximizes revenue stability (via contracts) and fits the industry trend that “wind, solar… are very important” but so is nuclear reuters.com. It also addresses grid pressures by providing local supply. As a result, the company can capture high growth from AI/data centers while contributing to the sustainable energy mix.
Key Metrics for Long-Term Tracking
To ensure strategic agility and measure success over time, the company should track:
Generation and Capacity Metrics: Net MWh produced (by plant and by fuel type); utilization factors; project on-line dates versus plan.
Financial Performance: Free Cash Flow per project and per share, IRR of new projects, and payback period. Track these under stress scenarios (fuel price up/down). Also monitor wholesale power and capacity market prices in PJM and target RTOs (e.g. $/MWh and $/MW-day) to gauge market exposure.
Contractual Coverage: Percentage of capacity under long-term contracts (e.g. offtake or PPA coverage) versus merchant exposure. Particularly for co-located projects, track contracted price and duration.
Energy Mix and Emissions: Annual CO₂ emissions from new/old assets (given carbon pricing), and renewable/clean share of portfolio. In context of tech trends, monitor percent of power sold to data centers that is carbon-free.
Market and Demand Indicators: Growth rate of data center capacity in target regions (e.g. Northern Virginia MW of new build), regional grid load factors, and any changes in RTO rules (like carbon rules or capacity market reforms). Stay alert to policy shifts (e.g. renewable mandates for DCs pewresearch.org or nuclear incentives).
Operational Reliability: Forced outage rates and O&M cost per MWh for existing and new plants. This ensures acquired assets are performing to assumptions.
Regular review of these KPIs will help management adjust the strategy as AI/data center demand evolves. Together with the weighted scoring framework above, these metrics enable data-driven decisions on new projects or acquisitions in a rapidly shifting energy landscape.

1. Physical generation & utilization
From Capacity (MW) and Capacity Factor you can get:
Annual energy output (MWh/year)

Hourly / monthly / yearly generation profile
Once you have annual MWh, you can allocate by month or season depending on the case.
Plant utilization comparison across the 3–4 options
Who is baseload (CF ~ 92%), who is mid-merit / peaker, etc.

2. Operating costs & unit economics
Using Fuel Cost, Heat Rate, Fixed & Variable O&M, Escalation:
Fuel cost per MWh

(multiply Btu/kWh by 1000 to get Btu/MWh)
Variable O&M per MWh → given directly.
Total variable operating cost per MWh
Fuel + Variable O&M + Carbon cost per MWh (see section 4).
Annual fixed O&M cost

Total annual O&M over time
Apply O&M escalation rate (3% annually) over the economic life to forecast future years.
Levelized cost components
You can break LCOE into:
Fuel
Variable O&M
Fixed O&M
Carbon
Capital recovery

3. Capital costs & project finance metrics
From Capex, purchase price, construction time, capital structure, WACC, taxes, life, MACRS:
Total initial capital outlay
For “Build $/kW”:

For “Purchase Price $Million”: that’s already given.
Construction cash flow schedule
Use construction time (months) to spread capex over 24 months for build options.
Depreciation schedule (MACRS 5-year)
Compute yearly tax depreciation → tax shield.
Capital structure: Debt/Equity amounts

Interest expense from Cost of Debt (8%).
Required return to equity from Cost of Equity (12%).
Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)

with D/V = 0.6, E/V = 0.4, T = 40%.
Free cash flows (project & equity)
Once you add revenue assumptions (energy price, capacity payments, etc.), you can get:
EBITDA = Revenue − Fuel − Var O&M − Fixed O&M
EBIT = EBITDA − Depreciation
Net Income, Cash Flow from Operations, Free Cash Flow to Firm / Equity.
Valuation metrics
NPV, IRR (project IRR and equity IRR)
Payback period
DSCR if you assume a debt amortization schedule.

4. Carbon & policy exposure
From Carbon Emissions (lb/MWh) and Carbon Price ($/ton):
Carbon cost per MWh

Annual emissions (tons/year)

Annual carbon cost ($/year)
Tons/year × Carbon price.
Comparative emissions intensity across the technologies (fossil vs zero-carbon).
Scenario analysis: test what happens if carbon price is 0 / 50 / 100 $/ton.

5. Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE) & comparative economics
Combining all of the above:
Plant-level LCOE (all-in cost per MWh) for each option:
Include capital recovery (discount CFs at WACC or compute annuity of capex).
Add fuel, O&M, carbon.
LCOE breakdown by cost category to explain why one plant is cheaper / more expensive.
Comparison of “Build” vs “Buy” assets
Build options use $/kW capex + construction time.
Buy options use purchase price and maybe shorter remaining life.
Merchant vs contracted economics
Once you layer in assumed power prices / capacity revenues, you can compare:
Margin per MWh
EBITDA per MW
Return on invested capital.

6. Forecasts & scenarios over life
Using Economic life, O&M escalation, capital structure, tax rate you can forecast over 15–40 years:
Year-by-year:
MWh generated
Operating costs
Carbon costs
EBITDA, Net income, Cash flows
Debt service, DSCR
Different scenarios:
Fuel price shocks
Different capacity factors
Different carbon prices
Different power prices
So in short: this is enough to build a full multi-year project valuation model for each of the 3–4 assets, compute LCOE, emissions, and return metrics, and then compare “which project is better under which scenario.”

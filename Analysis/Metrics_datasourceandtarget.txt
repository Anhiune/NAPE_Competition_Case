## SUMMARY TABLE: All Formulas

| # | Feature | Formula |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Total Capex | `$/kW × MW ÷ 1,000` or Purchase Price |
| 2 | Capital/MW | `Capex ($M) × 1,000 ÷ MW` |
| 3 | Construction Time | Direct input |
| 4 | Annual MWh | `MW × CF × 8,760` |
| 5 | Capacity Factor | Direct input |
| 6 | Fuel Cost | `Heat Rate × Fuel Price ÷ 1,000` |
| 7 | Total Op Cost | `Fuel + Var O&M + Carbon Cost` |
| 8 | LCOE | `(Capex × CRF + Fixed O&M) ÷ MWh + Variable Costs` |
| 9 | Carbon Emissions | `lb/MWh × MWh ÷ 2,000` |
| 10 | WACC | `0.6 × 0.08 × 0.6 + 0.4 × 0.12 = 7.68%` |
| 11 | NPV | `-Capex + Σ(FCF ÷ (1+WACC)^t)` |
| 12 | IRR | Solve: `0 = -Capex + Σ(FCF ÷ (1+IRR)^t)` |
| 13 | Payback | `Capex ÷ Annual FCF` |
| 14 | Annual FCF | `EBITDA × (1-T) + Depreciation × T` |
| 15 | FCF/Share | `FCF ($M) ÷ 45` |

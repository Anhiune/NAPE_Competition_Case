## NOTES ON SOURCE USAGE

All financial calculations in the team's analysis are derived from the official case data [1][3] and the team's own financial model [7][8][9][10]. External sources [11]–[49] were used to:

1. Validate assumptions made in the case model against real-world market conditions
2. Provide industry context and comparable transaction data for benchmarking
3. Support the strategic recommendation with documented market precedents
4. Quantify risks and opportunities not explicitly modeled in the case data

Where external data differs from case assumptions (e.g., real nuclear PPA prices of $85–100/MWh vs. the $60/MWh case assumption), this is noted explicitly in the analysis as an upside case or conservative assumption.

## SLIDE 1 — TITLE SLIDE
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~30 seconds**

---

**What to say:**

> *"Good morning everyone. Thank you for having us.*
>
> *My name is Anh Bui, and I'm joined today by Minh Nguyen and Cuong Nguyen.*
>
> *In the next 15 minutes, we'll walk you through our strategic response to the Case Twist — a dissident investor threatening to take control of our company. We've analyzed the three strategic options given in the case, and we'll show you exactly why Option 3 — a Joint Venture with Amazon Web Services — is the clear winner.*
>
> *We used Talen Energy, a real company, as our model. Talen executed this exact strategy and their stock went from $60 to $389 — a 6.5x increase. We'll show you how to do the same.*
>
> *Let's begin."*

---
**Transition:** *"First, let me explain the situation we're facing."*

---

## SLIDE 2 — THE TWIST: DISSIDENT INVESTOR THREAT
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand (don't read this):**
- A "dissident investor" is also called an "activist shareholder." This is someone who buys a lot of stock in a company — not to support management, but to FORCE management to make changes.
- Right now, the dissident owns 9% of the company. That's about 4.05 million shares worth $1.8 billion.
- At 10% ownership (4.5 million shares), the dissident can legally call a "special shareholder meeting" to try to fire the CEO and replace the board.
- The dissident thinks management is too slow. They want FASTER value creation — bigger deals, higher stock price.

**What to say:**

> *"Here's the situation we're facing.*
>
> *A dissident investor — think of them as an aggressive shareholder who wants to force change — has quietly bought up **9% of our company**. That's about **4 million shares**, worth **$1.8 billion**.*
>
> *Here's why that's dangerous: once they hit **10%**, they can call a special shareholder meeting. At that meeting, they can propose to **fire our CEO and replace the entire board of directors**. They only need to buy about 450,000 more shares to reach that trigger.*
>
> *What does the dissident want? They think we're not moving fast enough. They want:*
>
> - *Higher stock valuation — from 30x EV/EBITDA to 35 or 40x*
> - *Faster free cash flow growth — beat our 30% per year target*
> - *A bold strategic move that connects us to the AI and data center boom*
>
> *In simple terms: they want us to do something big, do it fast, and make the stock go up. If we don't, they'll try to take over and do it themselves.*
>
> *The case gives us three options to respond."*

---
**Transition:** *"Let me briefly explain the three options before we analyze each one."*

---

## SLIDE 3 — THE THREE STRATEGIC OPTIONS
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~60 seconds**

---

**What to say:**

> *"The case twist gives us three paths:*
>
> **Option 1 — Integrate Downstream**: *Buy a data center company. We become both the maker of electricity AND the user of electricity. The idea is that data center companies trade at higher stock valuations — maybe 40 to 60 times earnings — so acquiring one might pull our multiple up.*
>
> **Option 2 — Sell Upstream**: *Get acquired by a big oil company like Shell or ExxonMobil. Our shareholders get an immediate cash premium — maybe 20 to 30% above the current stock price. But the company stops existing as an independent business.*
>
> **Option 3 — Joint Venture / Partnership**: *Partner with a hyperscaler like Amazon Web Services. We sign a long-term contract to supply them electricity from our nuclear plant, and we help them build a data center campus. We stay independent, but we get stable revenue and a higher stock valuation.*
>
> *Now let me show you how we analyzed each option — and why one of them is clearly better than the others."*

---
**Transition:** *"Before we dive in, let me show you the real-world example that proves our recommendation works."*

---

## SLIDE 4 — REAL-WORLD PRECEDENT: TALEN ENERGY
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- Talen Energy is a real company traded on NASDAQ under ticker TLN.
- Talen is almost IDENTICAL to our case company: same type (IPP), same market (PJM), same fuel mix (nuclear + gas + coal), same size (~13,000 MW).
- In March 2024, Talen sold a data center campus to Amazon Web Services for $650 million AND signed a long-term power purchase agreement to supply electricity from their nuclear plant.
- After that deal, Talen's stock went from about $60 per share to $389 per share — a 6.5x increase.
- One of the judges today, Darren Olagues, is the Chief Development Officer at Talen Energy. He worked on this exact deal.

**What to say:**

> *"Thank you, Anh. Before I analyze each option, I want to show you the real-world proof that our recommendation works.*
>
> *This is **Talen Energy**. They are a mid-sized IPP, based in PJM, with about 13,000 megawatts of capacity — including a 2,500 megawatt nuclear plant called Susquehanna. Sound familiar? That's almost exactly our case company.*
>
> *Here's what Talen did: In March 2024, they sold a data center campus to **Amazon Web Services** for **$650 million**. At the same time, they signed a **20-year power purchase agreement** to supply nuclear electricity to that data center — at about $85 to $100 per megawatt-hour, compared to the $51 wholesale price.*
>
> *What happened to their stock? It went from **$60 per share to $389 per share** — a **6.5 times increase** in less than two years. Their market cap went from $3 billion to $17.6 billion.*
>
> *This is not a theory. This is what actually happened. And our company — with **2,200 MW of nuclear in PJM** — can do the exact same thing.*
>
> *But here's the key insight: **Talen didn't stop at one deal**. After the initial sale, they kept acquiring more data centers to expand their AWS partnership. That proves this isn't a one-time event — it's a **compounding growth platform**.*
>
> *Now let me walk you through each of the three options."*

---
**Transition:** *"Let's start with Option 1 — acquiring a data center company."*

---

## SLIDE 5 — OPTION 1: ACQUIRE A DATA CENTER COMPANY
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- Option 1 means we BUY a company that operates data centers. We become a "vertically integrated" company — we make the electricity AND we consume it.
- The problem: data center companies are EXTREMELY expensive right now. QTS sold for $10 billion. Cyrus One sold for $15 billion. CoreWeave is valued at $35 billion+.
- A $20 billion market cap company cannot easily buy a $10+ billion data center company. You need to borrow heavily and issue lots of new stock.
- That borrowing and stock issuance destroys shareholder value in the short term. "Dilution" means existing shareholders own a smaller percentage of the company.
- No IPP has ever successfully acquired a data center company. Talen BUILT one — that's different.

**What to say:**

> *"Option 1 is to acquire a data center company.*
>
> *The theory sounds good: data center companies trade at very high valuations — 20 to 25 times EBITDA. If we buy one, maybe our combined company trades at a higher multiple too.*
>
> *But here's the problem: **data center companies are incredibly expensive**. In 2021, Blackstone bought QTS for $10 billion. KKR bought Cyrus One for $15 billion. CoreWeave is now valued at $35 billion or more.*
>
> *We are a $20 billion company. To buy a meaningful data center platform — say a $5 billion acquisition — we would need to:*
> - *Borrow $2–3 billion more in debt, which would drop our credit rating from BB to B+*
> - *Issue $1.5 billion in new stock, which **dilutes** existing shareholders by 20 to 30%*
> - *Integrate two completely different businesses — power plants and data centers — with different skills, customers, and cultures*
>
> *The financial result? After all the debt and dilution, our market cap would be **roughly flat** — around $20 billion. Our **FCF per share would actually go DOWN** in Year 1 and Year 2 because of integration costs.*
>
> *And here's the biggest problem: **no IPP has ever successfully acquired a data center company**. Talen didn't buy one — they BUILT one. That's a completely different execution model.*
>
> *The verdict: **Option 1 is high risk with uncertain reward**. It doesn't clearly create shareholder value."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let's look at Option 2 — selling the entire company."*

---

## SLIDE 6 — OPTION 2: SELL TO SHELL OR EXXONMOBIL
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- Option 2 means a big oil company — Shell or ExxonMobil — buys our entire company. We stop existing as an independent business.
- In a sale, shareholders typically get a "premium" above the current stock price. For power company acquisitions, that premium is usually 20-30%.
- At a 25% premium, shareholders would get about $555 per share instead of $444 — that's $111 per share more, or about $5 billion total.
- BUT: shareholders then have to pay capital gains taxes on that gain. And they miss out on any future upside.
- Look at Talen — their stock went from $60 to $389. If Talen had sold at a 25% premium in 2023, shareholders would have gotten maybe $75 per share. Instead, they held and got $389. That's 5x MORE value by NOT selling.

**What to say:**

> *"Option 2 is to sell the entire company to Shell or ExxonMobil.*
>
> *This delivers immediate value. At a **20% premium**, shareholders get **$533 per share** instead of $444 — that's **$89 per share more**. At a **30% premium**, they get **$578 per share** — that's **$134 more**.*
>
> *This sounds attractive. The dissident would definitely be satisfied — they get to cash out with a profit. And it eliminates all future risk.*
>
> *But here's what shareholders would give up:*
>
> *First, **capital gains taxes**. At a 20% tax rate, shareholders lose $18 to $27 per share immediately. Net gain after tax is only $71 to $107 per share.*
>
> *Second — and this is the big one — **you forfeit all future upside**.*
>
> *Look at Talen Energy again. In 2023, Talen's stock was around $60. If they had sold at a 25% premium, shareholders would have received maybe $75 per share. But because they didn't sell — because they executed the AWS partnership strategy — their stock is now **$389**. That's **5 times more** than the premium would have been.*
>
> *Option 2 gives you a **small, certain gain today** in exchange for **massive, probable gains tomorrow**.*
>
> *The verdict: **Option 2 is moderate reward, but strategic loss**. You get paid a premium to stop participating in the AI/data center opportunity."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let me show you Option 3 — the Talen model. This is our recommendation."*

---

## SLIDE 7 — OPTION 3: JV WITH AMAZON WEB SERVICES
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~2 minutes**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- Option 3 is EXACTLY what Talen Energy did. We partner with AWS — the world's largest cloud provider and the only hyperscaler that has already signed nuclear power deals.
- The deal has two parts:
  1. **Nuclear PPA (Power Purchase Agreement)**: We sell 1,500-2,000 MW of nuclear output to AWS at $90-100 per MWh — almost DOUBLE the current wholesale price of $51/MWh.
  2. **Data Center Campus**: We help AWS build a 100-200 MW data center on land next to our nuclear plant. We invest $200-400 million; AWS funds most of the construction. We sell or JV the completed campus for $750-900 million.
- The financial impact: the nuclear PPA alone adds $513 million per year in incremental revenue. That translates to about $6.67 per share in extra free cash flow.
- Current FCF/share is $10.20. After the PPA, it would be $16.87 in Year 1 — a 65% increase!

**What to say:**

> *"Thank you, Minh. Now let me present Option 3 — our recommendation.*
>
> *This is the **Talen Energy playbook**, adapted for our company. We partner with **Amazon Web Services** — the largest cloud provider in the world and the **only hyperscaler** that has already signed a nuclear power purchase agreement.*
>
> *The deal has two parts:*
>
> **Part 1 — Nuclear Power Purchase Agreement**:
>
> *We negotiate a **20-year contract** to sell nuclear electricity to AWS at **$90 to $100 per megawatt-hour**. Remember, we currently sell power into the PJM market at an average of **$51 per MWh**. This PPA nearly **doubles our price**.*
>
> *The math: 1,500 megawatts times 8,760 hours times 92% capacity factor times $95 per MWh equals **$1.15 billion per year** in nuclear revenue. Compare that to our current nuclear revenue at wholesale prices: about **$637 million per year**.*
>
> *That's **$513 million per year in incremental revenue** — just from re-pricing our nuclear output.*
>
> **Part 2 — Data Center Campus Development**:
>
> *We help AWS build a **100 to 200 megawatt** data center campus on land adjacent to our nuclear plant. We invest **$200 to $400 million**; AWS funds most of the construction. When it's complete, we sell or JV the campus for **$750 to $900 million** — the same thing Talen did with their $650 million Cumulus sale.*
>
> *What's the financial impact?*
>
> *The nuclear PPA alone adds **$513 million in revenue**, which translates to about **$6.67 per share** in additional free cash flow after taxes. Our current FCF per share is $10.20. After the PPA, it would be **$16.87 in Year 1** — that's a **65% increase**, FAR exceeding the 30% growth target the dissident demanded.*
>
> *And the best part? **No dilution**. We're not issuing new stock. We're funding this with our $260 million cash on hand plus project-level debt. Existing shareholders keep 100% of their ownership."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let me show you the complete financial picture over 5 years."*

---

## SLIDE 8 — OPTION 3 FINANCIAL IMPACT
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- Year 1: The PPA is signed. Nuclear revenue jumps from $637M to $1,150M. FCF/share goes from $10.20 to $16.87. Market cap re-rates from $20B to $30-35B as investors recognize the contracted revenue.
- Year 2: The data center campus sells for $750-900M. The company gets cash, the multiple keeps expanding.
- Year 5: EBITDA has grown substantially. At a 35x multiple, market cap reaches $45-55B. Share price reaches $1,000-1,200.
- Credit rating improves from BB to BB+ or BBB- because revenue is now contracted rather than volatile.

**What to say:**

> *"Let me walk you through the full financial impact of Option 3 — year by year.*
>
> **Year 1 — PPA Signed:**
> - *Nuclear revenue jumps from **$637 million to $1.15 billion***
> - *FCF per share increases from **$10.20 to $16.87** — that's **65% growth** in Year 1 alone*
> - *The market recognizes the contracted revenue and re-rates our stock. Market cap goes from **$20 billion to $30-35 billion***
> - *Share price: **$667 to $778***
>
> **Year 2 — Campus Sale:**
> - *Data center campus sells to AWS for **$750-900 million***
> - *Multiple keeps expanding as we demonstrate execution*
> - *Market cap reaches around **$38 billion***
>
> **Year 5 — Full Platform Operational:**
> - *Expansion phases are complete. We've added 300-500 MW of additional co-located capacity*
> - *We've acquired additional data centers near our other power plants — just like Talen did*
> - *At a **35x multiple**, market cap reaches **$45 to $55 billion***
> - *Share price: **$1,000 to $1,200***
>
> *Compare that to Option 2, where shareholders would have received $533 to $578 per share in a one-time sale. Option 3 delivers **twice the value** over 5 years — and shareholders **keep participating** in future growth.*
>
> *Credit rating also improves. Contracted nuclear revenue is much more stable than volatile merchant power. We expect an upgrade from **BB to BB+ or BBB-** within 2-3 years."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let me show you the data center acquisition strategy that makes this a compounding platform."*

---

## SLIDE 9 — PHASE 4: DATA CENTER ACQUISITION STRATEGY
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~75 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- This is the key insight from Talen Energy. After the initial AWS deal, Talen didn't stop. They kept acquiring data centers to expand the partnership.
- Talen's subsidiary "Cumulus Growth" has been buying existing data centers near their power plants — at cheap prices, then connecting them to nuclear power, which makes them much more valuable.
- We propose the same strategy: acquire existing data centers near our gas and nuclear plants for $250-530 million over Years 3-7.
- The return: data centers bought at $30-80 million can be replatformed with nuclear/gas PPAs and become worth 3-5x more. That's $750M to $1.6B in value creation.

**What to say:**

> *"Here's what makes Option 3 even more powerful: it's not a one-time deal. It's a **compounding growth platform**.*
>
> *After Talen sold the Cumulus campus to AWS, they didn't stop. Through a subsidiary called **Cumulus Growth**, Talen has been **acquiring additional data centers** near their power plants. They buy existing facilities at relatively low prices, connect them to nuclear or gas power under long-term contracts, and **multiply their value**.*
>
> *We propose the same Phase 4 strategy:*
>
> - *Year 3: Acquire an existing data center within 50 miles of our nuclear plant — estimated cost **$30-80 million***
> - *Years 4-5: Acquire or develop a 200-400 MW data center campus near our gas fleet — cost **$150-300 million***
> - *Years 5-7: Acquire 3-5 smaller edge data centers in secondary PJM markets — cost **$50-100 million***
>
> *Total investment: **$250-530 million** over 5 years.*
>
> *The financial return? Data centers acquired at $30-80 million can be replatformed with our nuclear or carbon-capture gas and become worth **3 to 5 times more**. Conservative estimate: **$750 million in value creation**. Base case: **$1.6 billion in value creation**.*
>
> *This is exactly what Talen demonstrated: the initial deal unlocks value, but the **follow-on acquisitions compound that value** over time."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let me show you how all three options compare side by side."*

---

## SLIDE 10 — COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS: ALL THREE OPTIONS
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- This is the "money slide" — the direct comparison that proves Option 3 wins.
- Option 1 (Acquire DC): Market cap stays flat at ~$20B, FCF/share goes DOWN in Year 1-2 due to dilution, execution risk is very high.
- Option 2 (Sell to Oil Major): Shareholders get immediate premium ($24-26B), but company stops existing. No future upside.
- Option 3 (JV/PPA): Market cap grows to $50B+ by Year 5, FCF/share increases 65% in Year 1, low execution risk because Talen already proved it works.

**What to say:**

> *"Let's put all three options side by side.*
>
> **Year 1 FCF/Share:**
> - *Option 1: **$8.50-9.20** — actually LOWER than today's $10.20 because of dilution*
> - *Option 2: **$0** — the company is sold, no more earnings*
> - *Option 3: **$16.87** — 65% growth, exceeding the dissident's demands*
>
> **Year 5 Market Cap:**
> - *Option 1: **$30 billion** — modest growth after heavy investment*
> - *Option 2: **$24-26 billion** — paid out to shareholders in Year 1, no growth after that*
> - *Option 3: **$45-55 billion** — 2 to 2.5x the current market cap*
>
> **Execution Risk:**
> - *Option 1: **HIGH** — no IPP has ever acquired a data center company*
> - *Option 2: **MEDIUM** — regulatory approval takes 12-18 months, NRC license transfer risk*
> - *Option 3: **LOW** — Talen already proved this works with the same partner (AWS)*
>
> **Preserves Independence:**
> - *Option 1: Yes*
> - *Option 2: **No** — company is sold*
> - *Option 3: Yes*
>
> *The weighted decision score:*
> - *Option 1: **2.45 out of 5***
> - *Option 2: **2.15 out of 5***
> - *Option 3: **4.80 out of 5***
>
> *Option 3 wins on virtually every dimension."*

---
**Transition:** *"Now let me show you why Option 3 dominates from an ESG perspective."*

---

## SLIDE 11 — ESG & SUSTAINABILITY
**Speaker: Minh Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- ESG (Environmental, Social, Governance) matters because it affects which investors can buy our stock and what multiple we trade at.
- ESG funds manage over $40 trillion globally. If we score poorly on ESG, these funds cannot invest in us.
- Hyperscalers like AWS, Microsoft, and Google have aggressive sustainability targets. They will ONLY buy power from companies with strong ESG profiles.
- Option 2 (sell to oil major) would DESTROY our ESG value — oil majors are divested by ESG funds.
- Option 3 makes us the #1 ESG-aligned IPP in PJM. Nuclear = zero carbon. Gas with CCUS = near-zero carbon.
- The ESG scorecard compares all 3 options across 6 dimensions: Carbon Intensity, Regulatory Risk, Hyperscaler Alignment, SEC Climate Readiness, Community Impact, Long-Term Sustainability.
- Option 3 scores 5 out of 5 on virtually every dimension. Option 2 scores 1 out of 5 on most dimensions.
- ESG Value: This positioning is worth $2-4 billion over 5 years in higher multiples and premium PPA pricing.

**What to say:**

> *"Let me show you why Option 3 is the clear ESG winner.*
>
> *This ESG scorecard compares all three options across six key dimensions:*
>
> **Carbon Intensity:**
> - *Option 1: **3 out of 5** — adding a data center increases our energy consumption without reducing carbon*
> - *Option 2: **1 out of 5** — an oil major owner makes our carbon story worse, not better*
> - *Option 3: **5 out of 5** — nuclear is zero carbon, and CCUS on gas gives us near-zero blended emissions*
>
> **Regulatory ESG Risk:**
> - *Option 1: **2 out of 5** — higher execution risk, unclear ESG path*
> - *Option 2: **1 out of 5** — FERC and DOJ will scrutinize an oil major buying nuclear assets*
> - *Option 3: **4 out of 5** — front-of-meter PPA is low regulatory risk with Talen precedent*
>
> **Hyperscaler Alignment:**
> - *Option 1: **4 out of 5** — we'd have a DC, but no power advantage*
> - *Option 2: **1 out of 5** — AWS, Microsoft, and Google may REFUSE to buy from an oil-major owned plant*
> - *Option 3: **5 out of 5** — perfect alignment with hyperscaler 24/7 carbon-free energy goals*
>
> **SEC Climate Disclosure Readiness, Community Impact, Long-Term Sustainability:**
> - *Option 3 scores **5 out of 5** on all three. Options 1 and 2 score 2-3.*
>
> *The bottom line: **Option 2 would DESTROY our ESG value.** If Shell or Exxon buys us, ESG funds holding \$40+ trillion will divest. Our multiple collapses.*
>
> *Option 3 does the opposite. We become the **#1 ESG-aligned IPP** in PJM. This positioning alone is worth **\$2-4 billion in incremental value** over 5 years through higher multiples and premium PPA pricing."*

---
**Transition:** *"Let me show you how we extend that ESG advantage with CCUS on our gas fleet."*

---

## SLIDE 12 — RISK ASSESSMENT & SOLUTION: CCUS VALUE STACK
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- CCUS = Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage. It captures CO2 from power plant exhaust before it enters the atmosphere.
- Our gas fleet is 6,500 MW — 50% of our total capacity — and produces the majority of our carbon emissions.
- Adding CCUS to gas plants creates a second value driver beyond the nuclear PPA.
- The CCUS Value Stack has three components:
  - 45Q Tax Credit: $12.5/MWh (federal tax credit for capturing CO2)
  - Carbon Cost Avoidance: $8.0/MWh (avoiding future carbon taxes)
  - Premium PPA Pricing: $7.5/MWh (hyperscalers pay more for low-carbon power)
  - TOTAL: $28/MWh additional value
- Combined Fleet Offering: Nuclear (2,200 MW, 0 CO2, 92% capacity factor) + Gas with CCUS (6,500 MW, ~72 lb CO2/MWh after 90% capture) = Blended ~15 lb CO2/MWh with 99.9% reliability
- NO OTHER IPP in PJM can offer this combination. This is our competitive moat.

**What to say:**

> *"Option 3 isn't just about nuclear. We also strengthen our gas fleet with **Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage — CCUS.***
>
> *Our gas fleet is 6,500 MW — half our capacity — and generates most of our carbon emissions. CCUS captures 90% of that CO2 before it reaches the atmosphere.*
>
> *Here's the CCUS Value Stack — the additional revenue we capture per megawatt-hour:*
>
> **Component 1: 45Q Tax Credit — $12.50 per MWh**
> *The federal government pays us \$85 per ton of CO2 we capture and store. At 90% capture on gas, that's \$12.50 per MWh of free money.*
>
> **Component 2: Carbon Cost Avoidance — $8.00 per MWh**
> *Carbon taxes are coming. At \$25 per ton, avoiding emissions saves us \$8 per MWh versus competitors who don't have CCUS.*
>
> **Component 3: Premium PPA Pricing — $7.50 per MWh**
> *Hyperscalers pay MORE for low-carbon power. They have sustainability mandates. We capture that premium.*
>
> **TOTAL: $28 per MWh in additional value from CCUS.**
>
> *Now look at our combined fleet offering:*
>
> | Fleet Component | Capacity | Carbon Intensity | Availability |
> |-----------------|----------|------------------|--------------|
> | Nuclear | 2,200 MW | 0 lb CO2/MWh | 92% capacity factor |
> | Gas with CCUS | 6,500 MW | ~72 lb CO2/MWh (90% capture) | Dispatchable |
> | **Combined** | **8,700 MW** | **~15 lb CO2/MWh blended** | **99.9% reliability** |
>
> *No other IPP in PJM can offer this:* **24/7 near-zero carbon power at massive scale with 99.9% reliability.** This is our competitive moat."*

---
**Transition:** *"Let me walk you through the regulatory landscape and how we navigate it."*

---

## SLIDE 13 — NUCLEAR REGULATORY & RISK MANAGEMENT
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- There are 4 regulatory bodies that matter: NRC, FERC, State PUC, and PJM RTO.
- NRC (Nuclear Regulatory Commission): Governs nuclear plant safety and licensing. For front-of-meter PPA, NO license change needed. For behind-the-meter, we need a license amendment, but Talen already got this approved.
- FERC (Federal Energy Regulatory Commission): Governs wholesale electricity markets. FERC is concerned about behind-the-meter reducing grid capacity. Our solution: front-of-meter PPA as primary path (no FERC approval needed), behind-the-meter as fallback. Talen's deal survived FERC review.
- State PUC: Governs siting permits. Nuclear sites already have industrial zoning. Pennsylvania PUC already approved Talen's campus. Low risk.
- PJM RTO: Regional grid operator. Concerned about capacity obligations if load moves behind the meter. Our solution: maintain front-of-meter to preserve capacity market revenue.
- The KEY insight: Front-of-meter PPA is our PRIMARY path. It requires NO regulatory approval because it's a standard bilateral wholesale contract. Behind-the-meter is a FALLBACK for extra value, not the base case.

**What to say:**

> |-----------------|-------------|------------|--------------|
> | **NRC** | License amendment for data center co-location | **Low-Medium** | Front-of-meter PPA needs NO license change. Behind-the-meter has Talen precedent: approved. |
> | **FERC** | Behind-the-meter reduces grid capacity | **Medium** | Front-of-meter PPA is primary — no FERC approval needed. Behind-the-meter is fallback. Talen survived FERC review. |
> | **State PUC** | DC siting permits | **Low** | Nuclear sites already have industrial zoning. PA PUC approved Talen campus. |
> | **PJM RTO** | Capacity obligation reduction | **Medium** | Maintain front-of-meter to preserve capacity market revenue. Offer replacement capacity from gas fleet. |

## SLIDE 14 — RISK ASSESSMENT & MITIGATION
**Speaker: Cuong Nguyen**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**Background you should understand:**
- Every strategy has risks. Being transparent about risks shows maturity to the judges.
- Risk 1: What if AWS doesn't want to partner with us? Mitigation: run a competitive bidding process with Microsoft, Google, and Meta too. They all need nuclear power.
- Risk 2: What if FERC blocks the behind-the-meter arrangement? Mitigation: structure as front-of-meter PPA as the primary path. Behind-the-meter is a fallback for even more value, not the base case. Talen's deal survived FERC review.
- Risk 3: What if PPA pricing drops? Mitigation: even at $75/MWh (worst case), we still get $290M/year in incremental revenue — much better than merchant.
- Risk 4: What if the dissident doesn't wait? Mitigation: announce the strategy immediately. Offer the dissident a board seat. Show clear, measurable progress quarterly.

**What to say:**

> *"Let me be transparent about the risks in Option 3 — and how we mitigate each one.*
>
> **Risk 1: Hyperscaler negotiation fails — what if AWS says no?**
>
> *Mitigation: We run a **competitive bidding process**. AWS isn't the only hyperscaler desperate for nuclear power. Microsoft already partnered with Constellation to restart Three Mile Island. Google is pursuing 24/7 carbon-free energy. Meta is in talks for nuclear PPAs. Multiple bidders drive price UP and reduce the chance any single negotiation fails. Probability of total failure: **LOW — about 20%**.*

> *Mitigation: We structure our primary path as a **front-of-meter PPA**. That's a standard bilateral wholesale contract — no FERC approval needed. Behind-the-meter is a fallback that captures even MORE value, but it's not required. And remember: **Talen's deal survived FERC review**. We have precedent.

We build in a **floor price clause at $80/MWh** to protect downside. The current market is highly favorable because nuclear supply is scarce and hyperscaler demand is overwhelming.*

## SLIDE 15 — RECOMMENDATION: OPTION 3
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~90 seconds**

---

**What to say:**

> *"Let me bring this all together. Our recommendation is **Option 3 — a Joint Venture and Nuclear Power Purchase Agreement with Amazon Web Services**.*
>
> *Here's why this is the only right answer:*
>
> **First — it delivers immediate, transformative FCF growth:**
> *FCF per share goes from $10.20 to $16.87 in Year 1 — that's **65% growth**, far exceeding the dissident's 30% target.*
>
> **Second — it preserves company independence:**
> *Unlike Option 2, we remain a publicly traded company. Our management stays in control. Shareholders continue to participate in upside.*
>
> **Third — it requires no equity dilution:**
> *Unlike Option 1, we're not issuing billions in new stock. Existing shareholders keep 100% of their ownership.*
>
> **Fourth — it's proven by real-world precedent:**
> *Talen Energy executed this exact strategy with AWS. Their stock went from $60 to $389 — a 6.5x increase. One of the judges today, Darren Olagues, was directly involved in that deal.*
>
> **Fifth — it creates a compounding growth platform:**
> *This isn't a one-time transaction. Like Talen, we will acquire additional data centers to deepen the AWS partnership over time. Each acquisition compounds value.*
>
> **Sixth — it satisfies the dissident:**
> *The dissident wants bold action and clear value creation. A nuclear PPA with the world's largest cloud provider — at nearly double the market price — is exactly the kind of strategic repositioning they're demanding.*
>
> *Our projected results:*
> - *Year 1 market cap: **$30-35 billion** (up from $20B)*
> - *Year 5 market cap: **$45-55 billion***
> - *Year 5 share price: **$1,000-1,200***
> - *Credit upgrade: **BB to BBB-***
>
> *This transforms the dissident's threat into a catalyst for the **largest value creation opportunity in our company's history**."*

## SLIDE 16 — CLOSING SUMMARY
**Speaker: Anh Bui**
**Time: ~45 seconds**

---

**What to say:**

> *"Here's our message to the judges and to any skeptical investor:*
>
> *'We recommend the Talen Energy playbook — a Joint Venture and nuclear PPA with Amazon Web Services — because it is the **only option** that simultaneously:*
>
> - *Delivers **+65% FCF/share growth in Year 1***
> - *Drives our multiple from **30x to 35-40x***
> - *Preserves company **independence***
> - *Requires **zero equity dilution***
> - *Creates a **repeatable, compounding growth platform***
>
> *'Like Talen, we will not stop at the initial deal. We will acquire additional data centers to deepen the AWS partnership and compound value over time.*
>
> *'This strategy transforms the dissident's threat into the largest value creation opportunity in our company's history.'*
>
> *Thank you very much for your time. We're happy to take questions."*

## APPENDIX: Q&A CHEAT SHEET

Use these quick answers to respond to likely judge questions:

| Question | Quick Answer |
|----------|--------------|
| **Why AWS specifically?** | AWS is the ONLY hyperscaler with a proven nuclear PPA track record (Talen deal). They have the largest data center pipeline (35+ GW). They're already proven to work with IPPs like ours. |
| **What if AWS says no?** | We run a competitive bidding process with Microsoft, Google, and Meta. Microsoft already did the TMI restart deal with Constellation. All hyperscalers need 24/7 carbon-free power. |
| **What about FERC risk?** | We structure as front-of-meter PPA (no FERC approval needed). Behind-the-meter is a fallback for extra value. Talen's deal survived FERC review. |
| **Why not just sell to Exxon for quick cash?** | A 25% premium = $555/share. But Talen shareholders who held got $389 vs the ~$75 they would have gotten from an early sale. Option 3 delivers 2x the value with less risk. |
| **Is the $95/MWh PPA realistic?** | Yes. Talen got $85-100/MWh. Constellation-Microsoft TMI is similar. Nuclear is scarce, hyperscaler demand is overwhelming. We have pricing power. |
| **What's the execution timeline?** | Month 0: Announce negotiations. Months 1-3: Sign PPA. Months 3-12: Develop campus. Month 12-18: Sell/JV campus. Years 2-5: Expansion phases. Years 3-7: DC acquisitions. |
| **How does this satisfy the dissident?** | 65% FCF growth in Year 1 vs their 30% target. Clear strategic direction. Multiple expansion from 30x to 35-40x. We offer them a board seat to participate. |
| **Who is Talen Energy and why do they matter?** | Talen is a real PJM-focused IPP with 13,000 MW including 2,500 MW nuclear — almost identical to our case company. Their AWS deal is the EXACT playbook we're recommending. Judge Darren Olagues is their Chief Development Officer. |
| **What if nuclear has a long outage?** | Nuclear CF is 92%. Our plant is a dual-unit with redundancy. PPA includes force majeure clauses. But even so, our gas fleet can provide backup under the same co-location model. |
| **How do you finance the campus?** | $260M cash on hand + $150M project-level debt. AWS funds most of the construction. No equity dilution required. |

Currrent Situation And Challenges
---PAGE BREAK---
Build
In consideration of 
Market Competition &
Financial Situation
550 MW CCGT using case Excel assumptions
CF ~60% →  ~2.89 TWh/yr (capacity × CF × 8,760)
Gas = 40–45% of U.S. generation; backbone dispatchable fuel
Economic profile
Capex = $1,150/kW →  ~$633M
Merchant PJM pricing volatile; capacity auctions uncertain
Returns depend on securing long-term contracts
Capex & returns
Meets dispatchable needs, but weaker ESG vs
nuclear/renewables
AI firms increasingly pursuing low-carbon power partnerships
Competitive positioning
---PAGE BREAK---
Buy
Acquire existing 550 MW CCGT (~$450M modeled)
CF ~70% → ~3.37 TWh/yr, no construction delay
Immediate capacity & cash flow
In consideration of 
Market Competition &
Financial Situation
Older units → efficiency decay; higher O&M
Gas = ~875 lb/MWh CO ₂  →  policy exposure
LNG export growth →  greater gas price volatility
Asset & carbon risk
Fastest capacity addition but non-scalable
Nuclear (18–20% of U.S. supply) grows mainly through life
extensions, limiting acquisition supply
Strategic fit
---PAGE BREAK---
Partner
In consideration of 
Market Competition &
Financial Situation
Long-term offtake →  stable cash flow
Shared capex improves IRR vs pure Build
Avoids full merchant PJM exposure
Economic strength
Data centers: 415 TWh/yr globally; U.S. = 45% share
Nearly half of U.S. capacity in 5 clusters; PJM/NoVA = epicenter
AI firms already partnering to reopen nuclear & expand generation
Market alignment
Co-located supply aligns reliability + sustainability
Most repeatable model across DC hubs
Competitive advantage
---PAGE BREAK---
Build
Industry-based build time: 24–30 months for CCGT construction
Execution burden
High upfront capex; interest carry throughout construction
Full merchant risk until COD
Cost exposure
Mid-merit plant (~60% CF in Excel)
Higher long-term carbon cost risk vs zero-carbon tech
Operational profile
In consideration of 
Operational & Execution
(Resources & Supply
Chain)
---PAGE BREAK---
Buy
Existing fleet in case shows mixed-age coal/gas/nuclear assets
Older assets →  higher forced outages + R&M capex 
Asset quality uncertainty
Nuclear = 18–20% of U.S. generation; growth mainly via life
extensions, not new builds →  limited availability
Efficient CCGTs near load hubs competitively priced
Market scarcity
Operational downside
In consideration of 
Operational & Execution
(Resources & Supply
Chain)
No design/siting control
Full carbon exposure retained
---PAGE BREAK---
Partner (Co-location)
In consideration of 
Operational & Execution
(Resources & Supply
Chain)
100–200 MW blocks sized to DC load (model-driven design)
Behind-the-meter reduces interconnection delays (case allows
behind/in-front of meter)
Co-located asset profile
Long-term contracts →  predictable dispatch
Smaller modular builds lower EPC exposure
AI firms already structuring JVs with power producers
Execution & operations advantages
JV structure, shared capex, regulatory load
Higher upfront coordination, lower long-term risk
Complexity

How Partner can look like?
Goal
100–200 MW blocks sized to DC load (model-driven design)
Behind-the-meter reduces interconnection delays (case allows behind/in-front of meter)
W hat SM U/NAPE Brings

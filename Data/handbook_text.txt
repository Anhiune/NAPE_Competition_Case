They will be the person responsible for receiving and submitting the team’s material. • No school name but only assigned team numbers are allowed on all the submission materials.  I.e. your ﬁle name should list your team #.  Do not refer to your university or team members names. • Team members’ ﬁrst names are allowed. Team names are allowed; however, we will refer to your team by its assigned number.  If selecting a team name, please refrain from picking names which would allow quick identiﬁcation of the school you represent. We are focused on ensuring the competition remains anonymous until the top 3 winners are elected for each category.  Any omission of this rule will automatically disqualify the team. 2) Timeline • The case will be emailed individually to all participating teams by Friday, November 7th, 2025.  We will also upload to each individual team Box folder. • Teams are required to send a conﬁrmation receipt email communicating they have received the case & handbook material. • All the teams are welcome to ask questions.
